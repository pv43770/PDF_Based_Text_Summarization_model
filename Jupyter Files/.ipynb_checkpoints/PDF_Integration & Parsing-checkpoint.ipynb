The relevant facts are \\nthese. The respondents are a private limited company \\nwhich was brought into existence to float various \\ncompanies including cotton mills. In November, 1932, \\nthe Basanti Cotton Mills Ltd. was incorporated and \\nthe respondents were appointed their managing agents. \\nTheir remuneration was fixed at a monthly allowance \\nof Rs. 500 and a commission of 3 per cent. on all gross \\nsales of goods manufactured by the Mills Company. \\nThe fixed monthly allowance was liable to be increased \\nin the event of the capital of the company being \\nincreased. The details are immaterial. lt appears \\nthat certain hundis were drawn by one of the directors \\nof the respondent company, acting in the capacity of \\nthe managing agents of the :Mill Company, in the name \\nof the Mill Company and the same were negotiated to \\nothers. The Nath Bank Ltd. claimed payment of \\nthese hundis. The Mill Company repudiated its \\nliability as it appeared from the books of the Mill \\nCompany that they had not the use of the sum of \\nRs. 1.80,000 claimed by the Nath Bank Ltd. under \\nthe hundis. The Nath Bank Ltd. instituted four suits ·I\\' \\n• \\nS.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1011 \\nagainst the Mill Company, in two of which the res-1950 \\npondent company were party-defendants. The Mill Comm;:.;;;n.,· of \\nCompany was advised to settle the suits and the res-Incom•·ta:r:. \\npondent company entered into an agreement with the w .. t Bengal \\nMill Company, the material part of the terms of which •. \\nrnns as follows ·- Calcutta Agency \\n• Ltd. \\n\" Memorandum of Agreement made between the \\nCalcutta Agency Limited of the one part and Basanti Kama c.

Under the said agreement, the respondent company \\npaid to the Mill Company Rs. 22,500 made up of \\n• \\n1012 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1950] \\nt9oO Rs. 18,107 as principal and Rs. 4,393 as interest in the \\n0 -:--:-1accounting year. The assessee company claimed this omm1ssioner o . \\nIncomo-ta:c before the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal as a deduc-\\nWeat Benadi tion permitted under section IO (2) (xv) of the Indian \\nv. Income-tax Act. The relevant part of that section \\nCalcutta Agency runs as follows :-\\nLtd. \"10. (1) \"The tax shall be payable by an assessee \\nKania o. J. under the head \\'Profits and gains of business, pro\\xad\\nfession or vocation\\' in respect of the profits or gains of \\nany bminess, profession or vocation carried on by \\nhim. \\n(2) Such profits or gains shall be computed after \\nmaking the following allowances, namely:-\\n.................................... \\n(xv) any expenditure (not being in the nature \\nof capital expenditure or personal expenses of the \\nassessee) laid out or expended wholly and exclusively \\nfor the purpose of such business, profession or voca\\xad\\ntion.\" \\nIn the statement of the case submitted by the \\nTribunal after reciting the fact of the incorporation of \\nthe company and the terms of the compromise mention\\xad\\ned above, the arguments urged on behalf of the assessee \\ncompany have been recapitulated. The first argument \\nwas that under the first proviso to section 7 of the \\nIndian Income-tax Act, this payment was liable to be \\nexempted. The Tribunal rejected that argument. On \\nthe reference, the High Court also rejected the same \\nand it was not presented before us. The next argu\\xad\\nment of the respondents was that in respect of \\nRs. 22,500 it was entitled to exemption under section \\n10(2) (xv) of the Income-tax Act on the ground that \\nthe payment was an expenditure which was not in the \\nnature of a capital expenditure or personal expenses of \\nthe applicant company but was an expenditure laid \\nout wholly and exclusively for the purpose of its busi\\xad\\nness. They urged that if the applicant company did \\nnot agree to pay this amount, Basanti Cotton Mills \\nLtd. could have brought a suit against the company \\nto realise this amount due on the hundis which would • \\n.. \\n-• \\nS.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1013 \\nhave exposed the applicant company to the public and 1950 \\nin order to save themselves from the scandal and main-\\ntain the managing agency they agreed to the deduction Commissioner of \\nof certain amounts from the managing agency commis. 1\"come-ta•, \\nsion due to it and thereby brought it within the West ,Bengal \\nprinciples of the decision of 1Vlitchell v. B. W. Noble Oalcutt.\"Agency \\nLtd.(1) The Tribunal found as facts: (1) That the Ltd. \\napplicant company agreed to pay off the decretal \\namount from the remuneration which they are entitled K.,nia o. J. \\nto get from the Basanti Cotton Mills. (2) The decree \\nwas passed against the applicant company evidently \\nfor certain misfeasance committed by its directors and \\nthe applicant company agreed to pay it off from its \\nremuneration. (3) The books of account of Basanti \\nCotton Mills Ltd. would show that they were paying \\nthe applicant company in full its remuneration and \\nthe books of the applicant company also show that it \\nwas entitled to its remuneration in full. (4) In the \\ncircumstances the Tribunal held that the expenditure \\nwas not laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose \\nof carrying on the business. (5) Besides, the Tribunal \\nwas of the opinion that in this case it was not a \\nrevenue expenditure at all. As the payment had to \\nbe made towards liquidation of the decretal amount \\nthe Tribunal held, in the circumstances of this case, \\nthat it was a capital payment. On behalf of the res-\\npondent it was argued in the further alternative that \\nthe Privy Council decision in Raja Bijoy Singh \\nDudhuria\\'s easel.\\') would cover the present case. That \\ncontention was rejected by the Tribunal. \\nThis statement of the case prepared by the Income\\xad\\ntax Tribunal and submitted to the High Court for its \\nopinion was perused by the parties and they had no \\nsuggestions to make in respect of the same. The state\\xad\\nment of the case was thus settled with the knowledge \\nand approval of the parties. When the matter came \\nbefore the High Court, Mr. Mitra, who argued the case \\nfor the present respondents, as shown by the judgment \\nof the High Court, urged as follows:-\" If the applicant \\ncompany had not agreed to pay the amount mentioned \\ni 1l [J 921) 1 R. B. 719. 12) 61.T,C. 449, \\n• \\n1014 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1950] \\n1950 in the aforesaid agreement, then the Basanti Cotton \\nMills Ltd. would have sued the company for the reali\\xad\\nOommi\"\\'•\"\"\\' of sation of the amounts due on the hundis and it seems \\nIncom•·tax, that there would have been no defence to the action. \\nWest Bengal T . Jd h b\\' d th l\\' t t v his wou ave su iecte e app ican company o \\nOa!cutt.\"Ag•ncy the danger of public exposure and in order to save \\nLtd. itself from the scandal and in order to maintain the \\nmanaging agency, the applicant company agreed to \\nKania o. J. deduct certain amounts from the managing agency \\ncommission and therefore such expenditure came with\\xad\\nin section 10(2) (xv) of the Act.\" The High Court \\nthereafter noticed several cases including 111 itchell\\' s \\ncase(\\') and towards the close of the judgment delivered \\nby Chatterjea J. observed as follows:-\"In this case it \\nis clear that the agreement was entered into with a view \\nto avoid the publicity of an action against the mana\\xad\\nging agents and consequent exposure and scandal and \\nin order to maintain the managing agency so that the \\ncompany could carry on its business as before. The \\npayment in question did not bring in any new assets \\ninto existence nor in my opinion can it properly be \\nsaid that it brought into existence an advantage for the \\nenduring benefit of the company\\'s trade. The Appellate \\nTribunal observed that the decree was evidently passed \\nagainst the appellant company for certain misfeasance by \\nits directors and the appellant company agreed to pay \\nit off from its remuneration ...... The object of the agree. \\nment was to enable the company to remove a defect in \\ncarrying on the business of the company and to earn \\nprofits in its business. Therefore this case is covered \\nby the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Mitchell\\'s \\ncase(\\') ...... \" Applying this line of reasoning the High \\nCourt differed from the conclusion of the Tribunal and \\nallowed the deduction to the respondent company under \\nsection 10(2) (xv) of the Income-tax Act, as claimed by \\nthe respondents. The Commissioner of Income.tax, \\nWest Bengal, has come in appeal to us. \\nNow it is clear that this being a claim for exemption \\nof an amount, contended to be an expenditure falling \\nunder section 10(2)(xv), the burden of proving the \\n(l) [1927] l K.B. 719. ... \\n.. • \\nS.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1015 \\nnecessary facts in that connection was on the assessee, 1950 \\nit being common ground that the commission was due -:--:-\\nand had become payable and was therefore the business cc7m\"\"0;\\'\" of \\nincome of the assessee company liable to be taxed in ,;.::m;;:;:.1 the assessment year. The jurisdiction of the High Court v. \\nin the matter of income-tax references is an advisory Calcutta Agency \\njurisdiction and under the Act the decision of the Ltd. \\nTribunal on facts is final, unless it can be successfully \\nKa1ita C. J, assailed on the ground that there was no evidence for \\nthe conclusions on facts recorded by the Tribunal. It \\nis therefore the duty of the High Court to start by \\nlooking at the facts found by the Tribunal and answer \\nthe questions of law on that footing. Any departure \\nfrom this rule of law will convert the High Court into \\na fact-finding authority, which it is not under the \\nadvisory jurisdiction. The statement of the case under \\nthe rules framed under the Income-tax Act is prepared \\nwith the knowledge of the parties concerned and they \\nhave a full opportunity to apply for any addition or \\ndeletion from that statement of the case. If they \\napproved of that statement that is the agreed state. \\nment of facts by the parties on which the High \\nCourt has to pronounce its judgment. In the present \\ncase the parties perused the statement of case and as \\ndisclosed by the note made at the end of it had no sug-\\ngestions to make in respect thereof. It is therefore clear \\nthat it was the duty of the High Court to start with \\nthat statement of the case as the final statement of \\nfacts. Surprisingly, we find that the High Court, in \\nits judgment, has taken the argument of Mr. Mitra as \\nif they were facts and have based their conclusion \\nsolely on that argument. Nowhere in the statement \\nof the case prepared by the Tribunal and filed in the \\nHigh Court, the Tribunal had come to the conclusion \\nthat the payment was made by the assessee company \\nto avoid any danger of public exposure or to save itself \\nfrom scandal or in order to maintain the managing \\nagency of the appellant company. The whole con-\\nclusion of the High Court is based on this unwarranted \\nassumption of facts which are taken only from the \\nargument of counsel for the present respondents before \\n• \\n• \\n1016 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1950) \\n1950 the High Court. The danger of failing to recognise \\n-. -. that the jurisdiction of the High Court in these matters \\nCommm•onu of· l d · d 1 l · f J T \\'b 1 \\n1 · t \" is on y a v1sory an t ie cone uswns o t ie n una \\n;,;:;m;~:a~z on facts are the conclusions on which the High Conrt \\nv, is to exercise such advisory jurisdiction is illustrated \\nOa\\'cutta Agency by this case. It seems that unfortunately counsel for \\nLtd. the respondents caught hold of Mitchell\\'s case(1) and \\n-basing his argument on the circumstances under which Ka,zia 0. J. d a payment could be escribed as a business expenditure \\nfalling within the terms of section 10 (2) (xv), argued \\nthat the facts in the present case were the same. \\nInstead of first ascertaining what were the facts found \\nby the Tribunal in the present case, the process was \\nreversed and the procedure adopted was to take Mit\\xad\\nchell\\'s case(1) as the law and argue that the facts in the \\npresent case covered the situation. In our opinion \\nthis is an entirely wrong approach and should not \\nhave been permitted by the High Court. The High \\nCourt fell into a grave error in omitting first to ascer\\xad\\ntain what were the facts found in the case stated by the \\nTribunal. The High Court overlooked that in Afitchell\\'s \\ncase(\\') the whole discussion started with a quotation \\nfrom the case stated by the Commissioners as the facts \\nof the case. \\nA scrutiny of the record in the present case shows \\nthat before the Income-tax Officer the assessees \\nclaimed only a deduction of the interest of Rs. 5,582 \\nas a permissible deduction under section 10 (2) (iii) of \\nthe Income-tax Act. That claim was rejected by the \\nIncome-tax Officer. When the matter went to the \\nAssistant Income-tax Commissioner it was argued that \\nthe Income-tax Officer was in error in not allowing the \\ndeduction of interest and was also wrong in not allowing \\nthe entire sum of Rs. 22,500 as a deduction on the \\nground that, that portion of the income (viz., Rs . .\\'22,500) \\nshould be treated as not earned or deemed to be earned \\nby the assessees at all, having regard to the decision \\nof the Privy Council in Raja Bijoy Singh Dudhuria\\'s \\ncase.(\\') The first paragraph of the order of the Appellate \\nAssistant Commissioner contains the following \\n(ll [1927) I K, B. 719. 12) 6 I.T.C. \\'49, \\n• • \\n\\' \\n.. • \\nS.C.R.

J. \\nto proved that the borrowing is for the purpose of the \\nbusiness and the loan was u:sed in the business, the \\ninterest cannot be allowed under section 10(2)(iii).\" \\nThe second objection raised before the Appellate \\nAssistant Commissioner was in these terms:-·\\' That \\nthe Income-tax Officer should have allowed the said sum \\nof Rs. 22,500 as allowable expenditure being alloca\\xad\\ntion of a sum out of the revenue receipt before it became \\nincome in the hands of the assessee.\" The wording of \\nthe objection and the argument noticed in the order of \\nthe Appellate Assistant Commissioner show that the \\ncontention was that this sum should be treated as not \\nhaving become the income of the assessee at all because \\nit was deducted at the source by the Mill company. \\nReliance was placed for this contention on Raja Bijoy \\nSingh Dudhuria\\'s case(\\'). The contention was· rejected. \\nAt the third stage, when the assessee urged his conten\\xad\\ntions before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, he \\nthought of urging as an argument that this was a per\\xad\\nmissible deduction under section 10 (2) (xv) because of \\nthe principles laid down in Mitchell\\'s case(2). No \\nevidence, it appears, was led before the Income Tax \\nTribunal, nor has the Tribunal recorded any findings \\nof fact on which the principles laid down in Mitchell\\'s \\ncase(\\') could be applied.

The \\nimpugned Act imposed the following restrictions on the owners of 40 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)) \\nz959 factories producing sugar by the vacuum pan process: (i) it -. . obliged them to deliver to the export agency specified by the \\nThe Lord E.rishna Central Government the quota of sugar allocated to them; (ii) it \\nSugar Mills Ltd .• made them suffer a loss on this delivery of sugar; and (iii) it \\nand Another exposed them to a penalty in case the delivery \\\\vas short of the \\nv. quota. By a notification issued under the Sugar (Control) Order, \\nThi! trnion of India 1955, which was made under·the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, \\nand Another the Central Government increased the price of sugar for internal \\nsales by 50 nP. per maund to enable the owners to recoup the \\nloss suffered by them by the delivery of the sugar for export. \\nThe petitioners contended that it was not permissible to take the \\nnotification issued under another statute into consideration and \\nthat the impugned Act offended Arts. 14 and l9(1)(f) and (g) of \\nthe Constitution. \\nHeld, (per Sinha, Imam, Kapur, Sobba Rao and Hidayatul\\xad\\nlah, JJ., Sarkar, J. dissenting) that the impugned Act was \\nconstitutionally valid. \\nPer Sinha, Imam, Kapur and Hidayatullah, JJ. The \\nrestrictions placed by the Act upon the fundamental rights of the \\npetitioners under Arts. 19(1)(0. and (g) were not unreasonable as \\narrangements \\\\Vere made to save them frotn Joss by increasing \\nthe price of sugar for internal sales, thus passing on the loss to \\nthe consumers in India. The reasonablrness of the restriction \\nand not of the law was to be determined, and if the restriction \\nwas under one la\\\\v but countervailing advantages were created \\nby another law passed as part of the same legislative plan, the \\nCourt must take that other law into account. The reasonableness \\nof the restriction was to be judged at the time it was challenged \\nand in the context of the circumstances then existing. The \\nnotification of the Central Government increasing the price of \\nsugar to enable the recoupment of the loss occasioned by the \\nexport could be taken into consideration in judging the \\nreasonableness of the restrictions. \\nState of Madras v.

To \\ngo beyond this would be to destroy the stability of legislation \\nand to introtluce an uncertain element.

The impugned Act which made the petitioners \\nsuffer a loss on the sale of a part of their produce imposed \\nunreasonable restrictions on their fundamental right to carry on \\ntheir business and was invalid. Though in deciding the \\nreasonablene1>s of the restrictions imposed by the impugned Act \\nall the prevailing conditions and circumstances had to be \\nconsidered, the notification increasing the home price of sugar \\ncould not be taken into consideration. The impugned Act neither \\nmade it obligatory on, nor empowered the Government to take \\nany steps to recoup the loss caused to the petitioners. The \\nincrease in the price dependetl solely on the arbitrary discretion \\nor generosity or sense of fair play of the Government. It would \\nbe intolerable in any legal system that a statute should be legal \\nwhen the Government chose to do a thing and illegal when it \\nundid it and so on from time to time at the choice of the Govern\\xad\\nment. Besides, there was nothing in the Essential Commodities \\nAct or the Sugar (Control) Order which authorised the Govern\\xad\\nment to increase the price for the sake of recouping to the \\nmanufacturers the loss caused to them by the impugned Act, and \\nthe validity of the notification increasing the home price of sugar \\nwas doubtful. \\nState of Madras v.

The export agency Hidayatullah J. \\nreminded the L.K.S. Mills that the industry had agreed \\nto finance the Export Agency Division by letting it \\nhave the sale-proceeds of sugar diverted for internal \\nsale less Rs. 10 per maund as an \"on account\" pay-\\nment. The export agency offered to show a concession \\nto the L.K.S. Mills, and asked them to sell sugar in \\ninstalments of 1,500, 1,500 and 1,565 bags with a week\\'s \\ninterval between each. It asked the L.K.S. Mills to \\nco-operate and let the export agency send documents \\nfor 1,500 bags at Rs. 35·69 nP. per maund ex-factory. \\nIt appears that a mistake was made in putting down \\n1,000 bags, but the meaning was perfectly plain. The \\nL.K.S. Miils, however, insisted that they were unable \\nto sell sugar at the controlled rate, and that as they \\nwere in financial difficulties, it was not possible to \\nhonour the documents as suggested by the export \\nagency. \\nThe L. K. S. Mills proving obdurate, the export \\nagency wrote on November 5, 1958, that it proposed to \\nsend documents for the full quota of 4,565 bags at \\nRs. 35·69 per maund. The L.K.S. Mills were requested \\nto retire the documents immediately, as funds were \\nneeded urgently for purchase of additional quantities \\nfor export to replace the quota diverted for \\ninternal sale. It enquired the name of the bankers \\nto whom the documents might be sent by the agency. \\nThe L.K.S. Mills, it appears, did not agree to any of \\nthe courses suggested, and the export agency wrote on \\nNovember 27, 1958, that the L.K.S. Mills were requested \\nto remit a sum of Rs. 1,88,216·63 nP. being the amount \\ncalculated at the rate of Rs. 35·69 nP. per maund in \\nrespect of the total sugar quota, less excise duty to be \\npaid by the L.K.S.

K. S. Mills saying that a demand draft for \\nThe Union °1 India Rs. 61,845·57 nP. was being sent, to which was attached \\nand Another th d l\" d dd d h c I E . e e ivery or er a resse to t e entra xcISe \\nHidayatullah ]. Officer of the factory for releasing the first instalment \\nof 1,500 bags. The L.K.S. Mills were asked to pay the \\nexcise duty and to clear the bags from bond and to \\nintimate to the agency that they had done so. Similar \\ndocuments were prepared for the other instalments and \\nforwarded through the Bank. The L.K.S. Mills, how\\xad\\never, did not agree to this, and the export agency \\nthereafter on December 18, 1958, sent a telegram that \\nunless the drafts were retired immediately, the quota \\nsugar should be kept ready for despatch so that \\ndelivery might be taken by the export agency. The \\nexport agency also informed the L.K.S. Mills that \\notherwise the name of the Mills would be communicat\\xad\\ned to the Chief Director, Sugar, as a defaulter. The \\nexport agency also sent an order for delivery of the \\nquota sugar, and required the L.K.S. Mills to depatch \\nit by goods train, freight to pay, consigned to the \\nexport agency. It also intimated that the Mills should \\ndraw on the export agency for the amount of excise \\nduty paid by the Mills plus \"on account\" payment at \\nRs. 10 per maund. Much was made of the error in \\ndescribing the quota as of D-29, but in view of what \\n· had already been understood, it cannot be suggested \\nthat the L.K.S. Mills were in any way misled. \\nThe L.K.S. Mills informed the export agency that \\ntheir bank position did not allow them to honour \\nthe drafts, nor despatch the desired quantity of sugar \\nat the rates mentioned by the agency. They also \\nstated that they were not able to despatch more than , \\n500 bags, as wagons over the Eastern Railway were • \\nlimited. The export agency, however, did not agree. • \\nFinally, the export agency demanded remittance of \\nthe sum of Rs. 1,88,216·63 nP. by the 25th January, \\nand gave the alternative to the L. K. S.

Mills are as follows: \\nAfter the letter of August 24, 1958 was sent, nothing \\nappears to have been heard by the export agency. \\nOn November 27, 1958, the export agency asked the \\nS. P. B. Mills to remit to it by December 15, 1959, \\nRs. 1,69,524. 77 nP. being the amount calculated in \\nthe same way as for the L.K.S. Mills. On December 14, \\n1958, in continuation of this letter a despatch order \\nfor the entire quota was sent in the same terms as in \\nthe other case. In reply, the S.P.B. Mills pointed out \\nthat they were working the Mills as short-term lessees, \\nhaving obtained the lease from the High Court of \\nAllahabad on payment of Rs. 6,10,000 as lease money \\nand Rs. 1,00,000 as security on August 6, 1956. They \\nalso pointed out that they were required to purchase \\nadditional machinery, stores etc., for a sum of Rs. 5 \\nlakhs, and that a sum of Rs. 3,43,500 was spent in \\nconnection with the repairs to the factory and wages \\nfor the period during which the factory was re-started. \\nThey further pointed out that they had suffered a loss \\nof Rs. 2,40,000 in the last season and another loss of \\nRs. 50,000 on account of the strike of cane-growers in \\nMarch, 1958; that all their sugar stock was pledged \\nwith the Punjab National Bank, Bijnor, against an \\nadvance of 75 per cent. of the price; and that there \\nwere arrears of cess amounting to about Rs. 5,50,000 \\nand that the lease money amounting to Rs. 6,10,000 \\nfor the next season was also due. They therefore, \\nexpressed their inability to send any sugar: They also \\nstated that if they redeemed the pledged sugar even \\nafter paying the \"on account\" money to the Bank, 52 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)) \\nz959 the Bank would be receiving Rs. 15-2-0 per maund \\n- less than the controlled price· of sugar. They further \\nTs\"\\' LoMrd Ku,.,L· htdna stated that it was not possible for them to sell sugar \\nugar \\' s ., 1 . fi b h . d and Another at the contro led pnce xed y t e Drrectorate an \\nv. ended by saying that they were not in a position to \\nThe Union of India despatch sugar, pointing out at the same time that \\nand Another the Act was unconstitutional and not binding on them. \\nHidayotullah ], The export agency, however, was not agreeable, and \\nit asked the S.P.B. Mills either to deliver the export \\nquota or pay the net sale-proceeds for the same, \\npointing out that the Mills ran the risk of liability for \\nthe additional excise duty of Rs.17 per maund. \\nWhile matters stood at this stage ~nd the S. P. B. \\nMills had neither paid the amount demanded nor \\nagreed to despatch the sugar, a petition was filed in \\nthis Court and a temporary stay was obtained. \\nThe questions that have been raised in these peti\\xad\\ntions are many, but they can be grouped under two \\nheads, viz., the vires of the legislation and the propriety \\nof the action taken under it. The argument about \\nthe vires challenges the Act as a whole and also clause \\nby clause. In regard to the vires of the Act, the peti\\xad\\ntioners draw attention to the statement of objects and \\nreasons, incorporated in one of the affidavits in the \\ncase. According to them, the declared object of the \\nAct is to earn foreign exchange. They contend that \\nif foreign exchange is so urgently needed, there should \\nhave been uniform legislation compelling other sugar \\nmanufacturers, who do not manufacture by the vacuum \\npan process, also to export sugar. This argument is \\nbased on alleged discrimination and on Art. 14 of the \\nConstitution. The petitioners further contend that \\nmanufacturers of commodities other than sugar are \\nnot compelled to export in a like manner, and thus \\nthere is further discrimination. \\nIn our opinion, this argument is without substance. \\nThe power of Parliament to make laws in relation to \\nforeign exchange is manifest. Entry No. 36 of the \\nUnion List specifically confers jurisdiction on Parlia\\xad\\nment to legislate in relation to foreign exchange. That \\nEntry, if interpreted widely, would embrace within J S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 53 \\nitself not only laws relating to the control of foreign I959 \\nexchange but also to its acquisition to better the n L --;;~ . h \\neconomic stability of the country. The need for s~~ar0\\n~1;u;~,;.: \\nforeign exchange to finance the various development and Another \\nschemes was, very properly, not disputed. It is thus v. \\nplain. that the object of the Act is in the public interest. The Union of India If we are to exist as a progressive nation, it is very and Another \\nnecessary that we carve out a place for ourselves in Hidayat,.llah J. \\nthe International market. The beginning has to be \\nmade, and many a time, it is at a great loss. That the \\nCentral Government has selected the sugar industry \\nfor an export programme does not mean that it cannot \\nmake a classification of the commodities, bearing in \\nmind which commodity will have an easy market \\nabroad for the purpose of earning foreign exchange. \\nDuring the Suez crisis, sugar was exported in large \\nquantities from this country, and earned 12·4 crores \\nas foreign exchange. There is nothing on the record \\nto show that export of other commodities was not also \\nundertaken, though it was pointed out in arguments \\nthat manganese ore was also exported in a similar \\nmanner to earn foreign exchange. It is quite obvious \\nthat the Central Government cannot order the export \\nof all and sundry manufactured commodities from the \\ncountry, without being assured of a market in foreign \\ncountries. Necessarily, the Government can only \\nembark upon an export policy in relation to these \\nproducts, for which there is an easy and readily \\navailable market abroad. For this reason also, sugar \\nproduced by the vacuum pan process may have been \\nselected, because such sugar is perhaps in demand \\nabroad and not.sugar produced by any other process. \\nIt must be realised that goods manufactured in our \\ncountry have to stand heavy competition from goods \\nproduced abroad, and even this export can only be \\nmade at great sacrifice, and is made only to earn \\nforeign exchange, which would not, otherwise, be \\navailable. \\nIn this view of the matter, it cannot be said that \\nthere is discrimination in so far as sugar manufacturers \\nby the vacuum pan process are concerned. Govern\\xad\\nment is the best judge as to which commodities are 54 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)) \\nz959 most likely to earn foreign exchange, and the selection \\n- . thus made is justifiable as a reasonable classification \\nTheLordKrishna • h · 1 h b\" f h A 1 h Sugar Mills Ltd., wh1c is re ated tot e o iect o t e ct, name y, t e \\nand Another earning of foreign exchange. \\nv. The next contention is under Arts. 19(1) (f) and (g) \\nThe Union of India and also 31 of the Constitution. The petitioners \\nand Another \\nHidayatullah ]. contend that the whole export programme in respect \\nof sugar amounts to an infringement of their fund\\xad\\namental rights under Arts. 19(1) (f) and (g), and \\namounts also to a compulsory acquisition of their pro\\xad\\nperty without payment of compensation. The peti\\xad\\ntioners analyse the scheme of the Act, and state that \\nit amounts to taking sugar from owners for sale abroad \\nat such price as it may fetch, the owners being paid \\nwhen such money is received, after deducting the \\nexpenses of the export agency and the cost of export. \\nThey state that the owners stand to lose, because, \\nadmittedly, sugar is going to be exported at a loss, \\nand the loss is to fall on the owners of factories. They \\nfurther state that if the necessity for foreign exchange \\nwas felt, the loss entailed in the earning of foreign \\nexchange should be borne by Government or be distri\\xad\\nbuted among all industries, or at least among all the \\nsugar producers in the country. It is urged that the \\nAct is an unreasonable restriction upon the fund\\xad\\namental rights to hold, acquire, and dispose of pro\\xad\\nperty and to carry on occupation, trade or business. \\nIn reply, the learned Attorney-General on behalf \\nof the Union as well as the Directorate of Sugar refers \\nto the negotiations which took place between the \\nGovernment and the sugar industry and the arrange\\xad\\nments which were made to save owners of factories \\nfrom the loss which is inevitable as a result of this \\nexport programme. We were taken through the \\nvarious Control Orders which were passed by Govern\\xad\\nment under the Essential Commodities Act about this \\ntime, fixing the. price of sugar for internal consump\\xad\\ntion. In particular, referenee is made to the Sugar \\n(Control) Order, 1955, Notification No. G. S. R. 661/ \\nESS. Com/Sugar dated July 30, 1958. It is pointed \\nout that by that Notification the price of sugar was \\nincreased by 50 nP. per maund on all internal sales .. -\\n. , \\nI S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 55 \\nto enable the factories giving their export quota to z959 \\nrecoup themselves for the loss, which might be entail- The Lord :.rishna \\ned. It was anticipated that the loss would be recouped sugar Mills Ltd., \\nif there was an increase of 50 nP. per maund in and Another \\nthe price of sugar for internal consumption and the v . \\nexport quota was fixed at 2i per cent. of •the total The Union of India \\nproduction of a factory for 1957 -58. The loss, it was and Anoth., \\nexpected, would be more than set off by the excess Hidayatullah J. \\nprice which the producers would be able to get for \\nevery 20 maunds sold for internal consumption. It \\nis also pointed out that Government at that time did \\nnot wish to take over the work of export on itself \\nand specified as the export agency, the Indian Sugar \\nMills Association, a body composed of 95 per cent. of \\nthe sugar mills in the country. The learned Attorney-\\nGeneral also points out that more than 95 per cent. \\nof the mills have stood by this arrangement, and did \\neither supply their quota of sugar or sold it in the \\ninternal market and made available the money for \\npurchase of sugar for export. Only a few mills in the \\ncountry resorted to these devices to get out of the \\ncommitment which the industry as a whole had \\nentered into. The learned Attorney-General also \\ncontends that the petitioners had obtained favourable \\nprices for sale of sugar in the country but were not \\nwilling to honour their other commitments which, \\nafter the agreement of the sugar industry, were given \\nlegislative form. \\nLearned counsel for the petitioners contends that \\nthe vires of the Act should be considered without \\nreference to other circumstances such as the agree\\xad\\nments, price adjustments and price control, as they \\nhave no bearing upon the resonableness of the legis\\xad\\nlation. In State of Madras v. V. G. Row (1), this Court \\nlaid down that in judging the resonableness of a \\nrestriction upon fundamental rights, the surrounding \\ncircumstances can be looked into. Patanjali Sastri, \\nC.J., observed as follows : \\n\" It is important in this context to bear in mind \\nthat the test of reasonableness, wherever prescribed, \\nshould be applied to each individual statute impugned, \\n(1) [1952J s.c.R. 597, 607. 56 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] \\n\\'959 and no abstract standard, or general pattern of reason-\\nTh L . ableness can be laid down as applicable to all cases. \\nsu~a:\\':ti~;·1;~~ The nature of the right alleged to have been infring\\xad\\nand Another \\' ed, the underlying purpose of the restrictions im-\\nv. posed, the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be \\nThe Union of India remedied •thereby, the disproportion of the imposition, \\nand Another the prevailing conditions at the time, should all enter \\nHidayatullah J. into the judicial verdict. In evaluating such elusive \\nfactors and forming their own conception of what is \\nreasonable, in all the circumstances of a given case, \\nit is inevitable that the social philosophy and the \\nscale of values of the judges participating in the deci\\xad\\nsion should play an important part, and the limit to \\ntheir interference with legislative judgment in such \\ncases can only be dictated by their sense of respon\\xad\\nsibility and self-restraint and the sobering reflection \\nthat the Constitution is meant not only for people of \\ntheir way of thinking but for all, and that the major\\xad\\nity of the elected representatives of the people have, \\nin authorising the imposition of the restrictions, con\\xad\\nsidered them to be reasonable.\" \\nIn Virendra v. The State of Punjab (1), S. R. Das, \\nC.J., again reaffirmed this approach. See also Aruna\\xad\\ncha\\'la Nadar v. State of Madras(\\'). \\nIt is, however, contended that though one can look \\nat the surrounding circumstances, .it is not open to \\nthe Court to examine other laws on the subject, unless \\nthose laws be incorporated by reference. In our \\nopinion, this i.s a fallacious argument. The Court in \\njudging the reasonableness of a law, will necessarily \\nsee, not only the surrounding circumstances but all \\ncontemporaneous legislation passed as part of a single \\nscheme. The reasonableness of the restriction and not \\nof the law has to be found out, and if restriction is \\nunder one law but countervailing advantages are \\ncreated by another law passed as part of the same \\nlegislative plan, the Court should not refuse to take \\nthat other law into account. \\nThe existence of such other law is not difficult to \\nestablish. The Courts can take judicial notice of it. As \\nwas laid down by the Privy Council in Attorney-General \\n(1) [1958] S.C.R. 308, 318. (2) 1959 S.C.J. 297, 299-301, S.C.R.

In the same connection, their Lord\\xad\\nships looked into the historical background of legii;i\\xad\\nlation to find out the materials which were coni?idered \\nbefore the legislation was promoted in the legislature. \\nSee also Ladore v. Bennett (2). This Court also in \\nArunacluila Nadar v. State of Madras(8), examined the \\n\\' historical background \\' and discovered the object of \\nthe Act, \"from the circumstances under which it was \\npassed.\" \\nThat other oontemporaneous legislation passed as \\npart of a legislative plan can be ex11-mined was clearly \\nlaid down by the Privy Council in Pillai v. Muda\\xad\\nnayake (\\'). In that case, the question was whether \\nthe Ceylon Citizenship Act (18 of 1948) and the \\nCeylon (Parliamentary Elections) Amendment Act \\n(48 of 1949) were valid, or were ultra vires the \\nCeylon Parliament, being void under s. 29(2) of the \\nCeylon (Constitution and Independence) Order-in\\xad\\nCouncil, 1946 (as amended). Under the first two Acts, \\nthe Indian Tamils were denied as a community, the \\nright of franchise unless they came within the terms \\nof the first Act. They were thus subjected to dis\\xad\\nabilities and restrictions which were prohibited by \\n(1) (1939) A.C. u7, 130. \\n(2) (1939) A.C. 468, 477. \\n8 (3) ~959 S.C.J. 297, 299-301. \\n(4) (1953) A.C. 514. 58 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1960(1)] \\n\\'959 s. 29(2) of the Order-in-Council. During the course of \\nTh L d K . h arguments, their Lordships\\' attention was drawn to a. \\n5,.~.:~m;•;_,;~ later Act, intituled the Indian and Pakistani Residents \\nand Another (Citizenship) Act (3 of 1949), under which the Indian \\nv. Tamils and others were entitled to get themselves \\nThe Union °! India registered a.s the citizens of Cey Ion on proof of \\nanti Another sufficient connection with Ceylon. It was argued by \\nHidayati<llah 1 Mr. Pritt, Q.C., before the Privy Council that the later \\nAct could not be read to justify the earlier Act, because \\nif the impugned Citizenship Act were bad when it was \\npassed, it could not be \\'brought back to light\\' by the \\nenactment of the subsequent Act. Their Lordships \\ndid not accept this argument and read the later Act \\nwith the previous. They observed : \\n\" It was argued that sections 4 and 5 of the \\nCitizenship Act made it impossible that the descen\\xad\\ndants, however remote, of a person who was unable to \\nattain citizenship himself. could ever be able to attain \\ncitizenship in Ceylon no matter how long they resided \\nthere, but their Lordships\\' attention was subsequently \\ndrawn to the Indian and Pakistani Residents (Citizen\\xad\\n.ship) Act, No. 3 of 1949, by which an Indian Ta.mil \\ncould by an application obtain citizenship by registra\\xad\\ntion and thus protect his descendants, provided he had \\na certain residental qualification. It was suggested \\non behalf of tho appellant that this Act might itself \\nbe ultra vires as conferring a privilege upon Indian \\nTamils within s. 29(2)(c) of the Constitution Order-in \\nCouncil, and that i herefore it was inadmissible to \\nrebut the inference that the legislature had intended \\nby the Citizenship and Franchise Acts to make Indian \\nTamils liable to dis>il>ilities within the meaning of \\ns. 29(2)(b), but their Lordships cannot accept this \\nargument. If there was a legislative plan the plan \\nmust be looked at as a whole, and when so looked at \\nit is evident, in their Lordships\\' opinion, that the \\nlegislature did not intend to prevent Indian Ta.mils \\nfrom attaining citizenship provided that they were \\nsufficiently connected with the island. \" \\nIt is not necessary to speculate as to the remedies of \\nthe sugar dealers if the Sugar Control Order, or the \\nnotification were varied or abrogated in future. The S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 59 \\nreasonableness of the restriction is to be judged today z959 \\nand in the context of the circumstances now existing. The Lord Krishna \\nIt cannot but be accepted that the Government sugar Mills Ltd., \\nmade adequate arrangements to recoup the sugar and Another \\nindustry for the loss which it might suffer in giving .y. . \\nthe export quota. For that purpose though the The Union °1 Ind\"\\' \\nfi d 21 \\' f h . and Another export quota was xe at 2 per cent. o t e total \\nquantity produced by a factory, the loss which was Hidayatullah J. \\nexpected to be Rs. 10 per maund was spread over the \\nremaining sugar to be sold in the country and was \\nrecouped at 50 nP. per maund. We are unable to \\naccept th~ plea that the petitioners were not able to \\nsell sugar at the controlled price, because the price was \\nfixed too high. Learned counsel for the petitioners \\ncontend that by fixing a ceiling there is no guarantee \\nthat the commodity will be sold at the ceiling price \\nand not at a lower rate. It is a well-known proposi-\\ntion that when commodities are controlled by fixation \\nof price, the commodities sell only at the controlled \\nprice and not less. Economists have complained that \\nthe worst fault of price control is that the price does \\nnot fall below the controlled rate. There is nothing \\nin the record of the case to show that the Mills were \\nnot able to sell their sugar at the controlled price. \\nWe are satisfied that the object of the Act does not \\ninfringe the fundamental rights of the petitioners. To \\nprevent any loss to the petitioners, countervailing \\nadditional prices were allowed on sales of sugar for \\ninternal consumption. The petitioners did not stand \\nto lose ultimately. The quota was fixed at 2! per cent. \\nof their total production, and it is inconceivable that \\nthey are unable to sell sugar in the open home market. \\nThis suggestion of the petitioners that they are unable \\nto sell sugar at the controlled price has not been \\nsubstantiated by the production of a single document \\nto show what they held in stock and what they had \\nsold. The balance sheet produced by the S. P. B. Mills \\nshows that they were able to sell more than a lakh of \\nbags in eight months, as against the quantity of 4,079 \\nbags for export. \\nIt is obvious that the plea that the Mills are unable \\nto sell sugar at the controlled price is a mere sham. 60 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] \\nr959 Indeed, an examination of the correspondence in the \\nfirst case clearly demonstrates that the Mills were The Lord K rislina devising one excuse or another to a void the liability Sugar Ii-fills Ltd., \\nandAnother to supply the quota of sugar. ]\\'irst, they raised the \\nv. contention that they did not have the requisite grade. \\nThe Union of !>ldia Then they raised the contention that they could not \\nand Another sell sugar. Thereafter they asked for supply in instal-\\nHidayatullah J. ments, and when instalments were fixed, they put \\nforth the excuse of there being no wagons available. \\nThey next urged that the Bank was charging interest, \\nand that interest should be waived before the docu\\xad\\nments would be retired. When interest was waived, \\nthey filed the petition iu this CouJ.lt. In these \\ncircumstances, in our opinion, there can be no ground \\nfor holding that there has been an infringement of the \\nfund,imental rights of the petitioners. The restriction \\nwas not unreasonable, because arrangement was made \\nto save the owners of the factories from loss, and the \\nloss entailed by the export of sugar was to be borne \\nby the consumers in India and not by the producers. \\nThere is oue more circumstance which may be \\nconsiderecl. The foreign export served the national \\ninterest by staqilising the sugar market so that the \\nproduction of sugarcane niay be maintained at a \\nrea,;onable level. It also stabilised national economy \\nby earning foreign exchange. The loss, if any, was \\ncomparatively small and was spread over many \\nfactories. Apart from the very real possibility of its \\nbeing recouped by sales in the country, the loss itself \\nwas so small as not to amount to an unreasonable \\nrestriction. \\nThe petitioners next challenge the Act in its parts \\nto show that there is infringement of fundamental \\nrights or, in the alternative, compulsory acquisition of \\ntheir property without compensation. In this connec\\xad\\ntion, ss. 5 to 9 are challenged. Section 5 only permits \\nthe Central Government to fix the quota leviable from \\ndifferent factories. If the object and purpose of the \\nAct is valid and also is in the public interest, there \\nbeing no disadvantage to the owners ultimately, s. 5 \\nwhich fixes the quota for export from sugar produced \\nby a. factory cannot be challenged sepa.ra.tely •. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 61 \\nSection 6 makes it incumbent on the owner to supply z959 \\nthat! sugar on demand and further provides that after Th L d K . 11 \\ndeli~ery of sugar, the owner retains no rig~t exc~pt ~o su;a,0\\n~;11;:_,;;: \\nreceive payment therefor under s. 9. This sect10n is andAnother \\ncriticised on the ground that delivery of goods and v. \\npaym.ent of the price should be concurrent conditions, The Union of India \\nthat is to say, that the buyer should be ready and andAnother \\nwilling to pay the price in exchange for possession of Hidayatullah 1. \\nthe goods. If the Government w~s buying sugar, the \\nprovisions of s. 32 of the Indian Sale of Goods Act, \\nwhich is apparently relied upon here, might have been \\ninvoked. The object and purpose of the Act is to \\nexport sugar and to divide the receipts less expenses, \\namong the owners who supply sugar for export. The \\nargument over16oks the scheme that export is made \\nby a Central Agency for the industry as a whole, and \\nthe prices obtained abroad are payable, and they are \\nless than those at which sugar of various grades sells \\nwithin the country. The section does not suffer from \\nany infirmity, if the object and purpose of the Act is, \\nas has been found above, valid and constitutional. It \\nmust not be forgotten that during the time payment \\nwas due, the owners were getting an additional 50 nP. \\non every maund sold by them in the country. Deferred \\npayment is not deprivation of property, nor an en-\\ncroachment upon fundamental rights. The affidavits \\nshow that the entire quota of 50,000 tons has been \\nexported, that it has earned Rs. 2·4 crores in. foreign \\nexchange, and that the exporters have been paid \\nexcept for a small balance. \\nSection 7 is the penalty section. We heard consi\\xad\\nderable argument as to whether the section would \\napply to a case where no delivery was at all made, in \\nview of the words : \\n\"where sugar delivered by any owner falls short \\nof the export quota.\" \\nNo action has yet been taken against the Mills under \\nthe section ; nor has any penalty been imposed. The \\nquestion whether the section is ultra vires the legisla\\xad\\nture need not be considered here. \\nSection 8 deals with export of sugar or its sale by \\nthe owner or the export agency. It is stated that the 62 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] \\nz959 section deals with sugar delivered to the export agency, \\nT1\"LordKrishna and.here.there ~as no sugar delivered.

In the present cases, there \\nwas a demand for delivery of the sugar of the quota, \\nand that has not been met. Whether the petitioners \\nhave exposed themselves to any penalty can only be \\nconsidered when penalty is actually imposed on them. \\nThe condition that the sale-proceeds are payable to \\nthe export agency is perfectly valid, regard being had \\nto the scheme of the export and the advantage allowed \\non all sales in India. The owners having obtained that \\nadvantage cannot claim to keep the proceeds of such \\nsales, by which the export policy is to be run. Out of \\nthe 50,000 tons, about half was sold in India, and with \\nthe sale-proceeds other sugar was bought and exported, \\nand this would not be possible if the export agency \\nwere required to make a spot cash payment. \\nSection 9 provides how payments to owners are to \\nbe made. Since the export was by a non-profit-making \\nagency composed of the sugar industry, it is obvious \\nthat the payments could not be made forthwith. As \\nexplained already, the owners received payment after \\nthe sale prices were received from abroad. Necessary \\ndeductions of expenses have to be made, and the \\nproceeds are then distributed. No doubt, such payment \\nis likely to be somewhat delayed but looking to the \\nsmall quantity involved (i.e. not more than 20 per cent. \\nunder the Act and in actuality, only 2i per cent.) it was \\nnot likely to make it very hard for the owners, who \\nwere in the meantime breaking this loss at the rate of \\n50 nP. for every maund of sugar sold in India. In our \\nopinion, none of the sections considered here, even \\nviewed separately, is ultra vires. \\nThe petitioners did not cliallenge the action taken \\nby the export agency as being contrary to the Act. No \\nargument can be considered in view of the want of a \\nplea to this effect in the two petitions. In the petition -S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 63 \\nby the S. P. B. Mills, the petitioner did not invite any r959 \\ndecision on the correctness of the demand for the The Lord Krishna \\nadditional excise duty, because no such duty has, in Sugar Mills Ltd., \\nfact, been demanded. The main contention of the and Another \\nMills was that all sugar was pledged with banks.

They raise the question whether the Sugar \\nExport Promotion Act, 1958 is invalid as imposing \\nan unreasonable restriction on the petitioners\\' right to \\ncarry on their trade. \\nSome of the petitioners are owners of factories \\nmanufacturing sugar by a process called the vacuum \\npan process and they carry on business as manufac\\xad\\nturers of and dealers in sugar. For the purposes of \\nthis judgment these persons may be taken to be the \\npetitioners. The principal respondent in these applica\\xad\\ntions is the Government of India. The other respon\\xad\\ndent is the Indian Sugar Mills Association, an associa\\xad\\ntion of manufacturers of sugar by the vacuum pan \\nprocess. \\nOn June 27, 1958, the Government had promulgated \\nan Ordinance. The impugned Act was passed on \\nSeptember 16, 1958 repealing the Ordinance and re\\xad\\nenacting its provisions and also providing that anything \\ndone under the Ordinance would be deemed to have \\nbeen done under the Act as if it had come into force \\nwhen the Ordinance had been promulgated. \\nAs appears from its preamble, the Act was intended \\nto provide for the export of sugar in public interest \\nand it set up a machinery for that purpose. I will \\nsummarise here the main provisions of the Act. Sec\\xad\\ntion 3 empowers the Central Government to specify a \\ncompany or other body corporate as the export agency \\nto perform the functions of that agency under the Act. 64 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] \\nr959 The respondent Indian Sugar Mills Association was \\nThe Lord Kdsh\"a specified as the export agency under this section. \\nsugar Mill., Ltd., Section 4 authorises the Central Government to fix the \\nand Anotha quantity of sugar that may be exported during any \\n. v. . period, but the quantity so fixed for a year is not to \\nThe Umon of India exceed twenty per cent. of the quantity of sugar \\nand Another produced in India upto the month of October in that \\nSa>kar 1. year. 8eotion 4 also provides that. \"in fixing such \\nquantity the Central Government shall have regard to \\n-(a) the quantity of sugar available in India, (b) the \\nthe quantity of sugar which, in its opinion, would be \\nreasonably required for consumption in India, (c) the \\nnecessity for exporting sugar with a view to earning \\nforeign exchange in the public interest.\" Section 5 \\nrequires the Central Government to apportion the \\nquantity fixed under s. 4 among the owners of factories \\nproducing sugar by the vacuum pan process in pro\\xad\\nportion to the quantity produced or likely to be \\nproduced by them respectively, during the season. The \\nquantity so apportioned to each factory is called its \\nexport quot:t. Section 6 provides that every owner of \\na factory shall, on demand by the export agency \\ndeliver to it sugar upto its export quota and on delivery \\n\" the owner shall retain no rights in respect of such \\nsugar except his right to receive payment therefor \\nunder section 9.\" Section 7 makes provision for an \\nadditional excise duty being levied in certain circum\\xad\\nstances on the quantity of sugar by which the sugar \\ndelivered by the owner of a factory falls short of its \\nexport quota. Section 8 states that the export agency \\nshall export the sugar delivered to it, provided that in \\ncertain circumstances specified, the export agency may \\nsell that sugar in India and may if it thinks fit pur-· \\nchase other sugar for export and for this purpose permit \\nthe owner to sell the whole or part of its export .quota \\nat a price approved, on condition t.hat the sale proceeds \\nare paid to it. The provisions of s. 9 are important \\nand will be set out later. It is not necessary to refer \\nto the other provisions of the Act. \\nSoon after the Ordinance had been promulgated the \\nGovernment started taking action under it. By a \\nnotification dated June 27, 1958, 50,000 tons of sugar • S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 65 \\nwas fixed under s. 4 as the total quantity for export 1959 \\nfor the period ending October 31, 1958. Export quotas \\n~ The Lord /{rish11a were duly fixed for all factories including those of the suxar Mills Ltd., \\npetitioners. The petitioners were thereafter asked by and Another \\nthe export agency to sell the sugar and pay the sale- v. \\nproceeds to it.. This they failed to do. It is said by Thr Uuion °! India \\nthe respondents that the petitioners were also asked to and ~tlier \\ndeliver the sugar and this also they failed to do. The Sarkar]. petitioners spt, up various reasons justifying their failure \\nto sell or deliver the requisite quantities of sugar. rt \\nis unnecessary to refer to theRe reasons for if thn Act \\nis invalid, as \\'the petitioners contend the orders could \\nnot be made and no question would arise as to whether \\nthe petitioners had valid reasons for not carrying them \\nout. It appears that t.l1e export agency felt that the \\npetitioners were neither going to sell the sugar and pay \\nthe sale proceeds nor to deliver the sugar and it there-\\nupon pointed out to the petitioners that they were hy \\ntheir conduct exposing themRelves to the risk of \\nhaving to pay the additional excise duty under s. 7. It \\nwas then that the present applicationR for appropriate \\nwrits restraining the respondents from taking steps \\nunder the Act were launched by the petitioners on the \\nground inter alia that the Act was invalid as it \\nunreaRonably restricted the petitionerR\\' right to carry \\non their trade. I now proceed to examine the ,-alidity \\nof this contention. \\nFrom the provisions of the Act earlier set out, it is \\nquite clear that it requires the owner of .a sugar factory \\nto part with a portion of the produce of his factory in \\nexchange for an amount to he fixed under the provi\\xad\\nsions of s. 9. The Act therefore restricts his freedom \\nof trade; it takes away his right to trade with the \\nwhole of his merchandise in any manner he likes. The \\nquestion is, is such restriction reasonable ? . \\nIt is necessary now to set out the terms of s. 9 of \\nthe Act which fixes the amount which a manufacturer \\nof sugar in entitled to receive in respect of the sugar \\ndelivered by him. Only sub-ss. (1) and (2) of this sec\\xad\\ntion need\\' be set out and they are as follows : \\nSection 9.-(l) The export agency shall, at such \\ntime as it thinks fit, make to the owners who have \\n9 66 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)) \\n\\'959 delivered sugar to it under this Act, payments deter-\\nT\\'· L dK. h mined in accordance with the provisions hereinafter in \\n,~ or ris Ha th\\' . . d Sugar Mills Ltd., IS sect10n contame . \\nand Anothtr (2) From the total sale-proceeds in respect of the \\n. v. . quantity fixed for export under section 4 for any year, \\nTh• a~\\'\\';n1,~;ut,. there shall be deducte~ the total expenditure incurred \\nby the export agency m respect of the sugar, whether \\nSarkar J. by way of administrative expenses or otherwise, and \\nthe balance shall be appportioned among the owners \\nin proportion to the quantity of sugar delivered by \\nthen respectively during that year. \\nThe substance of the matter then is that an owner \\nof a sugar factory gets in exchange for the sugar deli\\xad\\nvered by him under the Act, a proportionate share of \\nthe sale-proceeds less the Pxpenses. He has no hand \\nin deciding at what price the goods would he sold by \\nthe export agency. If they are sold for a very low \\np;ice, he has no right to complain. Neither has he any \\npower to control the expenses. The exchange value \\nthat a sugar manufacturer is entitled to get under the \\nAct for sugar delivered by him, therefore, depends \\nentirely on the export agency. Again, under sub\\xad\\nsec. (1) of s. 9, the export agency need pay the manu\\xad\\nfacturer only at such times as it thinks fit. It may he \\ndifficult to say that all these terms are reasonable. \\nHowever that may be, there is another aspect of the \\nquestion which in my view decides it. It is quite plain \\nthat as things are, sugar can be sold abroad only at a \\nloss. That clearly appears from the materials on the \\nrecord and is not indeed disputed. I think it enough to \\nrefer to the Objocts and Reasons of the Act and to a \\nstatement in the affidavit of Shri K. P. Jain, Chief \\nDirector, Directorate of Sugar, affirmed on February 13, \\n1959 and filed on behalf of the Government, to show \\nthat the Act contemplated that the export of sugar \\nmade under it would result in a loss. In the Objects \\n& Reasons of the Act it is stated, \\n\"With a view to earning foreign exchange it is \\nnecessary to promote export of sugar. The export of \\nsugar, however, involves a loss, even if excise duty \\nand cane cess are remitted.\" S.C.R SUPREME COURT REPORTS 67 \\nIn paragraph 22 of Shri Jain\\'s said affidavit it is z959 \\nstated, T\\' . \"If h h th t\\' h . d iieLordKf<shM urt er Ray t at... e en ire sc eme envisage sugar Mills Ltd. \\nin the Act depends on the pooling of the losses on and Another \\' \\nexport by all sugar factories in India, in proportion to v. \\ntheir export quota.\\'\\' The Union of India \\nWe then get to this that on the respondents\\' own and Another \\ncase the exports under the Act can he made only at a· Sakrar J. \\nloss. The result therefore is that the Act compels the \\np()titioners to part with a portion of their merchandise \\nat\\' a loss. Can the restrictions so put on the petitioners\\' \\ntrade by the Act then be said to be reasonable ? I \\nconceive it is impossible to do so. It is said that the \\nAct was passed with a view to earn foreign exchange \\nby export of sugar. Indeed so it appears from the \\nObjects & Reasons of the Act earlier set out and the \\nprovisions of s. 4 earlier quoted. I will agree that \\nearning of foreign exchange is essential for the country. \\nBut I do not see that that justifies the enactment of a \\nlegislation which imposes a loss on a sugar manufac-\\nturer. It is not as if foreign exchange could not be \\nearned without inflicting loss on the manufacturers of \\nsugar. That indeed is not the respondents\\' case. The \\nloss might have been avoided if for example, the \\nexports were made by the grant of a subsidy, a course \\nin fact adopted by the Government in the year 1951-52. \\nIt.has not been said that there was any diffieulty in \\ngranting the subsidy for the exports under the Act. A \\nreasonable restriction on a citizen\\'s right to carry on \\nhis trade which alone is permitted by Art. 19(6) of the \\nConstitution, must be, as Mahajan, J., said in Chintaman \\nRao v. The State of Jl;Jadhya Pradesh(1), a restriction \\n\"which reason dictates\", which \"unlei;s it strikes a \\nproper balance between the freedom guaranteed in \\narticle 19(1) (g) and the social control permitted by \\nclause (6) of article 19, must be held to be wanting in \\nthat quality.\" Here I do not find the balance struck \\nnor the infliction of the loss a course which reason \\ndictates. The loss which the restrictions imposed by \\nthe Act on the petitioners\\' trade caused to them, was \\nby no means such as could only have been avoided by \\nincurring a greater loss. \\n(1) [1950] S.C.R. 759, 763. 68 SUPREME COURT REPOH.TS [1960(1)) \\n\\'959 I also think it clear that an object however laudable, \\ncannot by itself and without more, make a restriction The Lord Krishna \\nS«gar Mills Ltd .. put on a citizen\\'s right to carry on a trade for attain-\\nand Another ing that.object, reasonable.

The reasonablent>SS has to be judged Sarkar]. in ;111 the circumstances of the case and the object to \\nbe attained is only one of such circumstances. This, \\nin my view, is too clear to require elaboration. \\nIt is not neeessary for me to pursue the matter \\nfurther for it is not the respondents\\' contention that \\nthe 1·estrictio11s are reasonable notwithstanding that \\nthey <\\'anse loss. On the other hand, the contention of \\nthe respondents is for reasons to be presently stated that \\nthe Act really caused no loss and that being so the \\nrestrictions imposed by it cannot he said to be un\\xad\\nrea.sonable. I proceed now to consider t.he respondents\\' \\nrea.son for saying that the Act imposes 110 loss on the \\nsugar manufacturers including the petitioners. \\nIt is fi1·st s;1id that though the exports result in n \\nloss now, it may in future bring in profits. That hope \\nis dearly only a pious hope. Aud whaf\" is more, it is \\nnot a hope which has even been expressed in the \\nnffidavits filed. on behalf of the respondents. On the \\ncontrary, these affidavits make it perfectly plain that \\nin the foreseeable future there is no hope of export of \\nsugar being made at a profit. Indeed, it is said in \\nthese affidavits that the scheme of the Act is bnsed on \\nthe pooling of the losses caused by the exports made \\nunder it. It is hardly neeessary to point out that if \\nthe exports con kl be expected t.o prnduce a profit in \\nin the near future, the nocrcivc machinery of the Act \\nfor making the exports would he unnecessary. There \\nis no bn,is whntcver for snying that in some years the \\nexport may result in a profit. Indeed on the respon\\xad\\ndents\\' own affidavits it is not open to them to say \\nthat they hope that it may be possible in future to \\nmake a profit oil export of sugar. \\nThen it is said that the export quota. fixed for \\n1957-58 is only 2! per cent. of the production of each S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 69 \\nfactory. The point sought to be made is that, there- I9.S9 \\nfore, the amount of the loss would be very small. Now The Lord Krishna 2l per cent. of the produrtion of the factory of the Sugar Mills Ltd., \\npetitioners in Writ Petiti01n No. 9 of 1959 is 12,533 and Another \\nmaunds. It is stated by t.he respondents in the sup- v. \\nplementary affidavit of Shri Jain affirmed on March 11, The Union of India \\n1959, that on the export the loss will be in the region and Another \\nof Rs. 10 per maund. On this basis the loss to the Sarkar J. \\npetitioners in that petition would be Rs. 1,25,530. \\nThe loss to the petitioners in Writ Petition No. 14 of \\n1959 would be slightlY. less. I for myself would hesitate \\nto say that losses in such amounts are negligible. The \\nexport quota for 1958-59 has been fixed at 5 }Jer cent. \\nof the production. Naturally, the loss would be much \\nlarger. The Government have the right under the \\nAct to increase the quota upto 20 per cent. The loss \\nif the quota i;:; increased to the utmost would be for-\\nmidable. In the cases of factories with larger produc-\\ntion the losses would be much larger than the peti-\\ntioners losses. And of course the reasonableness of \\nthe restrictions imposed by the Act has to be tested \\ngenerally and without reference to any particular sugar \\nmannfacturer. I am also unable to agree to the \\nproposition that the reasonableness of a restriction \\ndepends on the quantum of the loss it produces. Even \\na small loss may conceivably make a restriction caus-\\ning it, unreasonable. The quantum of the loss cannot \\nby itself decide the reasonableness of the restriction. \\nDoes reason dictate that a small loss shall be inflicted? \\nNothing that has been said in this case leads me to \\nhold that. \\nIt is then said that the loss caused by the Act was \\nrecouped by an order made by the Government in\\xad\\ncreasing the home price of the sugar and therefore in \\nfact the manufacturers suffered no loss. The process \\nof recoupment was thus stated in paragraph 14 of the \\nsaid main affidavit of Shri Jain: \\n\" The incidence of loss on the first quota of 50,000 \\ntons fixed by the Government was assessed and when \\nthe Central Government fixed the price of sugar for \\ninternal consumption under the provisions of the \\nEssential Commodities Act and the Sugar (Control) 70 f;UPREME <\\'OORT HEPOHTS [i!l60(1)] \\nOrder, 1955, they gave adjustment in price by adding \\n50 nP. per nrnuud in the ex-factory prices of sugar for The Lord Krishna internal s:iles.\" I959 \\nSugar J.1.,Jills Ltd., \\nand Anoth\" It is said that the increase so made in the home price \\nv. of sugar would completely wipe out the loss incurred \\nThe Union vf In.i;a on the export under the Act of 2~ per cent.. of thl\\' \\nand Anothu produce of a factory. I will accept this as a correct \\nS1irkar J. estimate. I will also ignore the petitioners\\' contention \\nthat they had not been able to Hell the sugar in the \\nhome m,trket at t,hc incre•tsed price. · \\nThe argument then is that though the impugned \\nAct produces a loss, that loss can he ignored because \\nthe Government has taken steps under another Aut to \\nrecoup the loss so occasioned. It is s1tid that in the \\ncircumstances that prevail, namely, the increase in the \\nhomo price, the restrictions imposed by the impugned \\n.\\\\ct cannot he said to be unreasonable, for on the whole \\nthey occasion no loss. This is indeed the principal \\ncontention of the respondents to establi\"h tfoit t.lie \\nrestrictions are not unreasonable. \\nNow a reference to the Essential Commodities Act \\nunder which t,he home price was increased ha\" to be \\nmade, Jt. wa\" passed in Hie year 1955. It was not \\nintended to ont·n foreign exchange; indeed it had \\nnothing to do with foreign exchange or with helping \\nthe sugar industry. Section 3 of this Act provides: \\n\"Section 3. (l) If the Central Government is uf \\nopinion that it is necessary or expedient so to do for \\nmaintaining or increasing supplies of any essential \\ncommodity or for securing their equitable distribution \\nand availability at fair prices, it may, by order, provide \\nfor regulating or prohibiting the production, supply \\nand distribution thereof and trade ,i,nd commerce \\ntherein. \\n(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the \\npowers conferred by sub-section (l), an order made \\nthereunder may provide \\n(c) for controlling the price at which any essential \\ncommodity may be bought or sold.\" \\nSugar is an essential commodity within the meaning \\nof that term in the Act. Under the powers conferred S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 71 \\nby the section quoted above, on August 27, 1955,. the z959 \\nGovernment passed an ordf;lr called the Sugar (Control) The Lord Krishna \\nOrder, 1955.

The question then is, is the increase in the \\nhome price of sugar made by the Government by a \\nNotification issued under the powers given to it by \\nanother Act which has the effect of wiping out the loss \\ninflicted by the impugned Act, a circumstance which \\nmakes the restrictions imposed by the latter Act \\nreasonable? \\nIt is said that this is so ; that in judging the reason\\xad\\nableness of the restriction imposed by one Act, it is \\npermissible to consider an order made by the executive \\nGovernment under another Act.

That, in my v. \\nview, is not permissible. That is not a reasonable The Union of India \\nand Another test. It is not reasonable to say that the validity of a \\nstatute would depend on something which the execut\\xad\\nive Government may do or undo at any time. The \\nstatute imposing the restrictions does not give any \\nright that the Government would do something to \\nmake the restrictions reasonable. How can such a re\\xad\\nstriction be reasonable? How can an Act which is \\nprima facie unreasonable-and it is on that basis that \\nthe present argument arises-be held to be reasonable \\nbecause of something to which it gives no right and \\nthe existence of which depends entirely on the choice \\nof the executive Government ? Is it to be said that the \\nrestrictions imposed by a statute are reasonable \\nbecause the Government has, when the question crop\\xad\\nped up, done something which makes the restrictions \\nreasonable though it was not bound to do that and \\nthough it is free to undo that which it has done ? To \\nsay that would be to say that the Act is valid because \\nthe Government has for the time being chosen to \\nmake it so. This seems to me to be against all known \\nprinciples of law. \\nFurthermore, if the respondents\\' contention was \\nright a statute would then be legal when the Govern\\xad\\nment chooses to do a thing and illegal when it undoes \\nit and so on from time to time at the choice of the \\nGovernment. That would be intolerable in any legal \\nsystem. It was said that this is unavoidable and may \\nhappen in many cases. The following illustration was \\ngiven. Suppose in famine conditions a statute was \\npassed controlling free sale of foodstuff. Assume that \\nthe prevailing conditions made the restrictions put on \\nfree sale reasonable.

So, assuming that the appearance \\nand Another and disappearance of famine conditions from time to \\ntime made the Act o~ce valid and again invalid-as to Sarkar]. which I do not feel c lled upon to say anything now-\\nthat does not justify\\' the adoption of a rule which \\nwould make the validity of an Act depend on the \\nchoice of the Government. If fluctuating validity is \\nthe result in one case, it does not follow that the same \\nconsequence would occur in another and a totally \\ndifferent case. \\nAgain the validity of the Notification enhancing the \\nhome price seems to me to admit of grave doubt. I \\nfind nothing in the Essential Commodities Act nor \\nnaturally in the Sugar (Control) Order, 1955, which \\nwould authorise the Government to increase the \\nprice simply for the sake of recouping to the manu\\xad\\nfacturers the loss caused to them by the impugned \\nAct. I have earlier set out the relevant provisions of \\nthe Essential Commodities Act. The power to fix \\nthe prir ~ of sugar given thereby can be exercised \" for \\nmaintaining or increasing the supplies of any essential \\ncommodity or for securing their equitable distribution \\nand availability at fair prices\". That power cannot \\ntherefore be exercised for recouping loss caused to a \\nmanufacturer by another Act, the object of which is to \\nearn foreign exchange. If it is said that the Notifica\\xad\\ntion was issued for the purposes mentioned in the \\nEssential Commodities Act, it becomes at once apparent, \\nthat the price fixed under it has no relation to the \\nimpugned Act and may have to be altered irrespective \\nof the latter Act. I find it impossible to say that a \\nNotification fixing the price of sugar on different condi\\xad\\ntions can be taken into account in deciding the \\nreasonableness of the impugned Act which is entirely \\nunconnected with these considerations. \\nFor all these reasons I am unable to agree that the \\nNotification increasing the home price can be taken S.C.R.

It follows The Lord Kmr.na \\nth t th t . . d l t tl St<gar Mills Ltd., a ese res notions o cause oss o lC sugar and Anothtr \\nmanufacturers and there is nothing to show that the v. \\nrestrictions are even so reasonable. The Union of India \\nThen it is said that the Indian ~ugar Mills Associa- and •1\"01ner \\ntion of which the petitioners <1l\\'e Raid to be members, Sarkar J. \\nwanted that arrangements for export. of sugar abroad \\nbe made and it was for that reason that the impugned \\nAct was passed. It was suggested that the Association \\nagreed to the Act being passed. It is therefore contend-\\ned that the restrictions imposed by the Act must be \\npresumed to be reasonable and the petitioners cannot \\nbe heard to say that they are not. Now the request \\nby or the agreement of the Association is of course \\nnot the request by or the agreement ofthe petitioners. \\nThe Association has no authority to bind the peti-\\ntioners by any request or agreement. The fact that \\nthe petitioners were members of the Association if \\nthat were so, does not give the Association the \\nauthority. There is no evidence that the petitioners \\nhad assented to the Association making the request or \\nthe agreement. l!\\'or all that is known the petitioners \\nmay have been agaim;t the As::;ociation making any \\nrequest to the Government to take steps for export or \\nagreeing to the passing of the Act. Therefore, it \\nseems to me that the petitioners\\' rights are not affected \\nby anything which the Associctt.ion might have done. \\nI think it/ right also to say that there is no material \\non the record whatever to lmtd to the conclusion that \\nthe Association had agreed to the Act being passed in \\nthe form in which it stands. And of course it is only the \\nAct with which we arc concerned. It is true that the \\nAssociation had suggested that the Government should \\ntake steps for export of sugar. That would a.ppra.r \\nfrom the minutes of various meetings annexed to thl\\' \\naffidavits used on behalf of the Government. But there \\nis nothing in these minutes nor anywhere else in the \\nrecords which would indicate tlrnt the Association \\nwanted that sugar should be exported though that \\nmight put the manufacturers to a loss. The position \\nappears to have been this. In the yaar 1951-52 the 76 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)) \\n\\'959 sugar manufacturers were placed in a difficult position \\nThe Lo\"l Krishna because of competition from khandsari and gur \\nsugar Mills Lid.. manufacturers, who could buy sugar cane for their \\nand Another manufactures at a low price in the open market, while \\nv. the sugar manufacturers were compelled to buy cane at \\nThe Union °! India prices fixed by the Government which were high. So \\nand Another some of them, as appears from Annexure \"A\" to \\nSarkar J. Shri Jain\\'s said affidavit, made the following sugges\\xad\\ntions to the Government in March 1952 to give them \\nrelief: \\n\" (a) The price of cane be reduced to Re. 1 per \\nmaund. \\n(b) The sugar manufactured from the lower priced \\ncane be \\'frozen\\' and kept as a national Reserve for \\nExport or for such other purposes as the Government \\nmay consider desirable. \\n(c) To reduce the accumulation of stocks in the \\nfactories and to make room for further storage, and to \\nliquidate the stocks into cash, serious efforts be made \\neither from Government to Government or through \\ntrade channels to export out at least 2 lakh tons: Alter\\xad\\nnatively, the State Governments be asked to take \\ndelivery of the quantities from the factories and store \\nthem in their own godowns. \\n(d) If there is any \\'profit\\' in the export of such \\nquantities the same may be utilised either for giving a. \\n\\'bonus\\' to the cane growers or in lowering the price of \\nsugar for home consumption.\" \\nIt is clear from the suggestions thus made by the \\nmanufacturers that they wanted the burden on them \\nto be relieved and export at Government\\'s cost. In \\nthat year the Government in fact permitted an export \\nof 10,000 tons and gave a subsidy of Rs. 2 per maund \\nto cover the loss on the export. Later in the same \\nyear tho Government reduced the price at which the \\nsugar manufacturers could purchase the cane. \\nIn the years 1952-53 to 1955-56 India imported large \\nquantities of sugar and did not export sugar at all. \\nIt also appears that during these years the consumpt.ion \\nof sugar in India was much more than the production. \\nHence, obviously the need for the import. So clearly \\nin these years the sugar manufacturers did not need to S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 77 \\nexport their sugar.

The proposition then is that between 1952-53 Sarkar J. \\nand 1956-57 the industry was doing very well and had \\nno need to ask for Government\\'s intercession to enable \\nit to export. \\nThere is no evidence that in 1957 -58 there was. any \\nover-production. The figures for this year in tons are \\nproduction-19,75,000, consumption-20,14,000 and \\nexport-50,000, the figure for export being that fixed \\nunder the Act. It appears however that various \\nrepresentatives of the Government and the sugar \\nmanufacturers met and decided upon the idea of export\\xad\\ning sugar for earning foreign exchange in Government\\'s \\ninkrest and getting a foothold in the world market in \\nthe int~rests of the manufacfurers. It was realised \\nthat the export would result in a loss but the manu\\xad\\nfacturers agreed to export provided they were allowed \\nto make up the loss from the internal market. For \\nthis purpose the imggestion made as appears from \\nannexute \"D\" to the affidavit of Shri Jain, was as \\nfollows: \\n\"The internal market will be Jen free as at present. \\nHowever to provide an element of stability to the \\nmarket releases for internal sale shall be regulated by \\nGovernment of India in active consultation with the \\nindustry.\" \\nSo what the trade had agreed to was that they \\nwould be prepared to export sugar provided they were \\nleft free to recoup from the internal sales the loss \\ncaused by the export. This is very different from \\nagreeing to the Act which made no provision for \\nrecouping the loss from the internal sales. The sugar \\nmanufacturers did not approve of the Act, being con\\xad\\ntent to depend on the Government\\'s sense of fair play \\nto relieve the hardship caused by it. 78 SUPltEME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] \\n\\'959 There remains one other contention to deal with. \\nTh< Lord Krishna It · \\'d th t th · t\\' bl \\' h \\n5 M .11 Lid 1s sa1 · a · e restrw 1011s are reason a e smce t ey \"!:i A:o;h., ·· result in stabilising the sugar industry. Apart from \\nv. saying that the Act would stabilise the sugar industry, \\nThe Union of India the affidavits used on behalf of the respondents do not \\nand .1no1hu show how that would be done or that there was any \\nSarkar]. need for it. From what I have earlier stated it does \\nnot appear to me that the industry needed any stabi\\xad\\nlisation. The figures given earlier show that produc\\xad\\ntion has always been less than internal eonsumption, \\nexcepting for the year 1951-52. But it appears from \\none of the annexurcs to the affidavit of Shri Jain that \\neven \\'then the difficulty was only temporary. It is \\nthere stated : \\n\"Again in 1952-53 it was decided to export upto \\n2 lakh tons. But only about 10,000 tons could be \\nexported as in the meantime there was an appreciable \\nrise in the sugar prices and the surplus stock was \\nconsumed in the home m>trket.\" \\nThe estimated figures for th11 Y\\'\"\" 19:38-59 in tons \\nappear to be as follows: production-· 19,00,000 con\\xad\\nsumption-21,00,000, export-1,00,000. It would thus \\nappear that the sugar industry in India has always \\nbeen stable and did not require any export to make it \\nstable. \\nWhat I think however puts the matter beyond \\ntlou bt is s. 4 of the Act. Under that section, in fixing \\nthe total quantity of wgar to be exported in any \\nseason regard is to be had only to the quantity avail\\xad\\nable in India, the quantity required for consumption \\nin India and the necessity of earning foreign exchange. \\nl:;o in deciding the quantity to be exported no question \\nof stabilising the industry or prices arises. Again, it \\nis not out of the excess of the production over the \\ninternal consumption alone that the exports are to be \\nmade. In fact there has never really been any excess \\nof production over consumption requirements. Indeed \\nit is plain that if sufficient sugar were left to meet the \\nhome consumption, then the. increased price would not \\nhelp the industry to recoup the loss. If supplies were \\nadequate to meet the demand the price cannot be \\nforced up. \\' S.O.R.

I agree with his conclusion \\nbut would prefer to give my own reasons. The only \\njustification for me to write a separate judgment is my \\ninability to persuade myself to agree with one of the \\nreasons given by Hiday~tullah, J., for his conclusion. \\nThat reason involves a principle of far-reaching \\nimportance, namely, whether, in ascertaining the \\nreasonableness of restrictions imposed by a statute on \\na fundamental right, it is permissible to rely upon a \\nnotification issued by Government in exercise of power \\nconferred on it by another Act unconnected with the \\nimpugned one. · \\nBefore I embark upon the merits of the case it would \\nbe convenient at the outset to clear the ground by \\nexpressing my view on the said question. The facts \\nof the case have been fully stated by my learned \\nbrother in his judgment, and I need not restate them \\nexcept to notice a few relevant and material facts. The \\nEssential Commodities Act, 1955 (Act 10 of 1955), was \\nenacted for the purpose mentioned in the preamble to \\nthat Act. In exercise of the powers conferred by s. 3 \\nof the said Act, the Central Government issued an \\norder dated August 27, 1955, called the Sugar(Control) \\nOrder, 1955. Under r. 5 of the said order, the Central \\nGovernment is empowered, inter alia, to fix the price \\nor the maximum price at which any sugar may be sold \\nor delivered, having regard to the price or minimum 80 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] \\n\\'959 price fixed for sugar.cane, manufacturing cost, taxes, \\nThe Lord Kri>hna reasonable margin of profit for producer and/or trade, \\nSugar Mills Ltd., and any incidental charges. In exercise of powers con\\xad\\nand Anothn ferred on the Central Government under s. 3 of the \\nhe . v. Ind. said Act and cl. 5 of the said order, the Central \\nT a~;·~;:,~\\'\"\\' \\'\"Government issued a notification dated July 30, 1958, \\nfixing the ex-factory price for Indian sugar Standard \\nsubba Rao J. (ISS) D-29 grade. A few days before the said order \\nwas issued i.e., on .June 27, 1958, the Central Govern\\xad\\nment promulgated an Ordinance called the Sugar \\nExport Promotion Ordinance, and it was subsequently \\nconverted into an Act (30 of 1958), which received the \\nassent of the President on September 16, 1958. It is \\nsaid that the Central Government in fixing the price \\nfor sugar produced during the season 1957-58, in \\nvacuum pan sugar factories situate in the areas speci\\xad\\nfied in the order had taken into account the possible \\nloss the exporters might incur by reason of the applica\\xad\\ntion of the provisions of the impugned Act. Shri \\nK. P. Jain, Chief Director in the Directorate of Sugar& \\nVanaspati, Ministry of Food and Agriculture (Depart\\xad\\nment of Food), in his affidavit says that the ex-factory \\nprice of sugar per maund fixed by the said order was \\nmade up of the following items: \\nAverage cost of production \\nincluding margin of profit. \\nExcise duty. \\nCane cess. \\nLoss on exports. \\nTotal Rs. 22·91 \\nRs. 10·70 \\nRs. 1·89 \\nRs. 0·50 \\nRs. 36·00 \\nIt is explained therein that the factories are expected \\nto realise actually on their internal sales Rs. 22·91 as \\ntheir cost of production including margin of profit and \\nRs. 0·50 to cover losses of export which work out to \\napproximately Rs. 10, per maund of sugar exported. \\nFor every one maund of sugar exported, the factories \\nhave for sale in the internal market 20 maunds of \\nsugar, and on this, on account of the price fixed, they \\nwould realise 0·50 nP. per maund i.e., on 20 maunds \\nRs. 10, which covers the export loss.

In support \\nof this contention, he relied upon the decision of this \\nQourt in State of Madras v. V. G. Row (1 ).

The said limits are defined in cl. 4 \\nof the said article whereunder: \\n\"Nothing in sub-clause (c) of the said clause shall \\naffect the operation of any existing law in so far as it \\nimposes, or prevent the States from making any law \\nimposing, in the interests of public order or morality, \\nreasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right \\nconferred by the said sub-clause.\" \\nIn discussing the said question, Patanjali Sastri, C.J., \\nobserved at p. 607 : \\n\" It is important in this context to bear in mind that \\nthe test of reasonableness, wherever prescribed, should \\nbe applied to each individual statute impugned, and \\nno abstract standard, or general pattern of reasonl:!oble\\xad\\nness can be laid down as applicable to all cases.

If the validity of \\nan Act is made to depend upon such a foundation, a \\nsuper-structure will have been built on shifting sands. \\nTo do that is to destroy the stability of legislation and \\nto introduce an uncertain element therein. If two or \\nmore Acts were parts of the same scheme or plan, to \\nimplement the same or common objective, or if the \\nimpugned Act, though it was not originally conceived \\nat the time when the earlier Act was passed, was only \\nan extension or a further step by legislature for \\nimplementing the object of the earlier Act or if the \\nlegislature by express reference incorporated in the \\nimpugned Act the provisions of the earlier Act, it \\nwould be permissible to rely upon the said provisions \\nof the earlier Act, not because they formed part of the \\nprevailing ·conditions but because either the earlier \\nAct formed part of the impugned Act by reference or \\nboth of them formed part of the same legislative plan. \\nThe illustrations are not exhaustive, but they all fall \\nunder one or other of the following two categories : \\n(i) an earlier Act is made part of a new Act; and (ii) both \\nActs are parts of a legislative scheme or plan where \\nboth of them were conceived at the inception but \\npassed in stages, or conceived at different times on the \\nbasis of experience gained but passed in furtherance \\nof the same scheme. In such cases, the test of 84 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] \\n\\'959 reasonableness in regard to one Act may be made to \\n- depend upon the impact of the other on it.

It would also mean that a Court will have \\nto embark upon a roving search of all Acts and \\nnotifications which may, by design or accident, \\nalleviate or mollify the evil consequences of an \\nimpugned Act. Such a result cannot be contemplated. \\nThe learned Attorney-General has not placed before us \\nany decision in support of his broad propositian; but \\nI find in the judgment of my learned brother, \\nHidayatullah, J., a few decisions which, it is said, go to \\nthe full length of supporting the argument of the \\nlearned Attorney-General. I have carefully perused \\nthe said decisions and I do not find anything said gr \\nimplied therein to support the said contention. The \\ndecision in Attorney-General for Alberta v. Attorney\\xad\\nGeneral for Ca:nada (1) was concerned with a conflict \\nbetween the jurisdictions of the Dominion and Provin\\xad\\ncial Legislatures under ss. 91 and 92 of the British \\nNorth America Act, 1867, The Legislative Assembly \\nof the Province of Alberta passed an Act respecting \\nthe taxation of banks\\' and imposed thereunder on \\nevery corporation or joint stock company other than \\nthe Bank of Canada, incorporated for the purpose of \\ndoing banking or savings bank business in the \\nProvince, an annual tax, in addition to any tax \\npayable under any other Act. Defaulters of payment \\nof tax were to be visited with penalties, and the \\npayment of either tax or penalty could be enforced \\nby distress and sale of goods and chattels, or by \\naction for civil debt. It was contended before \\nthe Privy Council that the proposed taxation was \\nnot in its true sense taxation in order to the raising \\n(I) (1939) A.C. II7. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 85 \\nof a revenue for Provincial purposes so as to be within r959 \\nthe exclusive legislative competence of the Provipcial \\nLegislature, but was merely part of a legislative plan The Lord Krishna Sugar Mills Ltd., to prevent the operation within the Province of those and Another \\nbanking institutions which had been called into exist- v. \\nence and given the necessary powers there to conduct The Union of India \\ntheir business by the only proper authority, the and Another \\nParliament of the Dominion, under s. 91 of the British Subba Rao]. North America Act, and the Bill was therefore ultra \\nvires the Provincial Legislature. The Privy Council \\naccepted the contention. :For the purpose of ascertain\\xad\\ning the true plan underlying the bill, the Judicial \\nCommittee compared the relative legislative lists, took \\njudicial notice of other Acts and the object and purpose \\nof the Act in question. Having regard to the said \\nconsideration, it came to the conclusion that it was \\na colourable legislation aimed at to prevent the \\noperation within the province of the aforesaid banking \\ninstitutions. When a statute is attacked on the ground \\nthat it is a colourable legislation, i.e., it assumed a \\nform apparently faliing within the legislative compet\\xad\\nence of the legislature but in effect and substance \\nintended to reach institutions beyond its legislative \\ncompetence, it is obvious that all the surrounding \\ncircumstances, including other acts operating in the \\nProvince, have to be scrutinized to unravel the fraud \\non power. This decision, in my view, cannot be \\ninvoked to serve the present purpose. Nor does the \\ndecision of the Judicial Committee in Lad,ore v. \\nBennett (1) carry the matter further. The question \\nin that case was whether the Provincial legislation in \\nquestion did not encroach upon the exclusive legis\\xad\\nlative power of the Dominion Parliament in relation \\nto bankruptcy and insolvency, interest or pr iv ate rights \\noutside the Province. For ascertaining the pith. and \\nsubstance of the impugned statutes, the Judicial \\nCommittee relied upon th.e report of the Royal \\nCommission appointed to enquire into municipal and \\nother affairs of the four municipalities in question.

Section 4 enables the Central Government, by \\nnotification in the Official Gazette to fix from time to Subb,-i Rao]. time the quantity of sugar which may be exported \\nduring any period, and, in fixing such quantity, the \\nCentral Government should have regard to the \\nquantity of sugar available in India, the quantity of \\nsugar which, in its opinion, would be reasonably \\nrequired for consumption in India, and the necessity \\nfor exporting sugar with a view to earning foreign \\nexcl;iange in the public interest. In exercise of that \\npower, the Central Government should not fix the \\nquantity of sugar for export as to exceed in any year \\nin the aggregate twenty per cent. of the quantity of \\nsugar prorlnced in India in the season ending wit.h the \\nmonth of October falling within that year. Under s. 5, \\nthe Central Government is empowered to apportion \\nthe quantity of sugar fixed from time to time for. \\npurposes of export under s. 4 among the owners in \\nproportion to the quantity of sugar produced, or likely \\nto be produced, by them respectively during the season \\nreferred to above. :\\'-iection 6 enjoins on the owners of \\nsugar factories to deliver to the export agency, \\nappointed under the Act, the sugar produced in their \\nfactories in such quiintities, of such grade, in such \\nmanner, within such time and iit such place, as may \\nbe specified hy the export agency in that behalf. \\nWhen such delivery is made, the owner ceases to have \\nany more right over the sugar except to receive \\npayment ·therefor. Section 8 empowers the export \\nagency, after taking delivery, to export the sugar or \\npermit the owner to sell the whole or any part of the \\nexport quota in his custody at a price approved by it \\non condition that the sale-proceeds are payable to it. \\nSection 9 directs the export agency to make payments \\nto the owners, who had delivered sugar to it, in the \\nmanner prescribed by the section. Out of the total S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 89 \\nsale-proceeds, the total expenditure incurred by the z959 \\nexport agency in respect of the sugar exported should --\\nb d d d d l b 1 h ld b · d The Lord Krisllna e e ucte an tie a ance s ou e apport1one 5 , M\\'lt Ltd \\nh . • h t\" f \"~ar \\' s ., among t e owners m proportion to t e quan 1ty o and Another \\nsugar delivered by them for export during the year. v. \\nIt also enables the export agency to make payments TkUnion of India \\nto owners on account against documents of delivery of and Another \\nsugar furnished by them, and to adjust such payments Sub;;;: Rao J. \\nat the time of final payment. Section 10 confers \\npower on the Central Government to give directions \\nto the export agency in discharge of its functions \\nunder the Act. Section 7 deals with a situation when \\nthe ~ugar is not delivered, and it reads: \\n\"S. 7(1): Where sugar delivered by any owner \\nfalls short of the export quota fixed for it by any \\nquantity (hereinafter referred to as the said quantity), \\nthere shall be levied and collected on so much of the \\nsugar despatched from the factory for consumption in \\nIndia as is equal to the said quantity, a duty of excise \\nat the rate of seventeen rupees per maund.\" \\nSub-ss. 2, 3 and 4 provide for a machinery for \\nimposing the penal duty and collecting the same from \\nthe defaulting owners of sugar. The scheme of the \\nAct, therefore, is a self.contained one. The object is \\nto provide for the export of sugar in the interest of \\npublic and that object is sought to be achieved by \\nfixing the quota of sugar for export and distributing \\nthe same among the owners of factories; subject to the \\ncondition that in no case it should exceed twenty per \\ncent. of the quantity of sugar produced in India in a \\nparticular season. The quantity is also fixed \\\\vit.hout \\ndetriment to the requirements for internal consump\\xad\\ntion. The apportionment of the quota among the \\nvarious factories is objectively and impartially made. \\nThe quota delivered, or in case the owner is allowed to \\nsell the sugar himself, the sugar purchased from the \\nsale-proceeds, is· exported, and the nett sale-proceeds \\nare distributed among the owners in proportion to the \\nquantity of sugar delivered by them for export. The \\nAct enables the Government to make payments on \\naccount. The Government also retains an over-all \\n12 90 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] \\n,959 control presumably to see that no injustiee is done to the \\nparties concerned. The short question is whether the \\nTh• Lord Krishna said restrictions on the freedom of the petitioners to \\nSngar Milts Ltd .• acquire, hold and dispose of property, and carry on and Anoth.e1 \\nv. trade or business, are reasonable within the meaning of \\nTh• Unfon of India clauses (5) and (6) of Art. 19 of the Constitution. The \\nand Anoth<r restrictions must have a reasonable relation to the \\nobject which the legislature seeks to achieve and must \\nSubba Rao f. not go in excess of that object. What is the object of \\nthe legislature ? The object of the legislature is to \\nprovide for the export of sugar in public interest. It \\ncannot be, and indeed it is not, denied that at the \\ntime the Act was passed there was a sincere and serious \\nnational effort to industrialize our country with the \\navowed object of raising the economic standards of \\nour people. One of. the necessary conditions for \\nindustrializing our eountry is to start heavy industries, \\nand that cannot be done unless the country earn8 \\nforeign exchange to enable it to import plants for \\nstarting the same. It is also self-evident that it would \\nbe in the interests of sugar industry to build up a \\nforeign market for that commodity. The object of the \\nAct was, therefore, demorrntrably to serve the national \\ninterest and the scheme evolved certainly had relation \\nto the object sought to he achieved, for all the pro\\xad\\nvisions of the Act were conceived in :t glmuine attempt \\nto induce foreign export in sugar by co-operative effort. \\nIf so, the only ohjcetion to t.he rnstrictions imposed \\ncan be on the basis that the fr••edom w11,s abridged or \\ncurtailed unduly or arhitmrily. But for the Act, the \\npetitioners could have Kold their sugar in the open \\nmarket without exceeding the rnkK fix.,d under the \\nEssential Commodities Act, l!.J!i5. The correspondence \\nfiled in the case, marked \\'\" 1tn11exures A, H and C, \\nclearly demonstrates that both the irnlustry :i.s well as \\nthe 8tate were equally interested to stimulate foreign \\ntrade and build up a foreign market. Under the \\nscheme embodied in the Act, three restrictions are \\nimposed on the owners of factories: (i) They must \\ncontribute to the stock for export,. not exceeding \\ntwenty per cent. of the quantity produced in their \\nfactories; (ii) they are paid only their proportionate S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 91 \\nshare of the nett sale-proceeds realised in the foreign r959 \\nmarket; and (iii) a penal cess is imposed on those - . \\nwho make default in supplying the goods. When once The Lord Krishna . . d d h t h A t . h , l ·. t Sugar Mills Ltd., it is conce e t a t e c serves t e nat10na m erest, and Another \\nI find it not possible to hold that the restrictions v. \\nare unreasonable or excessive. The three restrictions The Union of India \\nare really the props of the scheme. If there was no and Another \\nstatutory compulsion on the owners of factories to \\nl bl f · f th d d . Subbn Rao], supp y a reasona e ract1on o e sugar pro uce m \\ntheir factories, the export agency would not get the \\nrequisite quantity of sugar for export. If there was \\nno provision imposing a penal cess on defaulters, \\nthere would be no sanction to compel them to deliver \\ntheir quota of sugar. Though the final payment was \\ndeferred till the nett sale-proceeds were realised, they \\nwould be paid the price for the sugar supplied, at the \\nrates fetched in the foreign market. It is common \\ncase that at present the export trade in sugar ends in \\nloss; but it cannot be predicated that it will be a \\nchronic feature and there will not come a time. when \\nthe export trade in sugar will earn profits. It may be \\nthat a better scheme migl).t have been evolved by the \\nlegislature or it might be more beneficial from the \\nstandpoint of owners of factories if t.he State purchas-\\ned the exportable <1uantity for ready cash and exported \\nthe same on its own account. But it is not for this \\nCourt to evaluate the comparative merits of different \\nschemes so long it is satisfied that the scheme actu-\\nally evolved stands the test of reasonabless. The \\ncorrespondence between the State and the industry \\nshows that the industry as a whole co-operated with \\nthe State in evolving the scheme, which culminated in \\nthe passing of the Act. The State as well as the \\nindustry are equally interested to stimulate foreign \\ntrade and build up foreign market. To capture foreign \\nmarket or to have a substantive share therein is not \\nan easy task, as it depends upon many imponderables, \\nnamely, the availability of sugar, its demand, its \\ncomparative ID;erit,s with the sugar produced in other \\nmarkets, transport facilities, mutual agreement requift \\nments, international affiliations etc. Initial loss \\nmust have to be borne to get a ~oothold and the clear 92 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] \\nz959 objective will have to be pursued purposrifully and tena-\\n- . ciously.

ThiH point was r!\\'jodml hy \\ntlw Bo1J(·h. The second point urged on hchalf of the \\nappl\\'llant was that on 8eptember · 16, 1952, when the ·S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 95 \\nMagistrate issued the warrant of arrest against the \\nappellant he could not have done so without having \\npreviously taken congnizance of the offence. Since, \\nhowever, the authorization required under s. 23(3) \\nof the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (VII of 1947) \\nwas not obtained till January 27, 1953, the cognizance \\ntaken by the Magistrate on September 16, 1952, was \\nwithout jurisdiction. If the initiation of the proceed\\xad\\nings was without jurisdiction, the conviction could not \\nstand. The High Court thought that the contention of \\nthe appellant raised a question of law and granted the \\nrequisite certificate for appeal to this Court. \\nThe prosecution case was that on September 7, 1952, \\nthe appellant went to Dum Dum Aerodrome with a \\nview to boarding a plane for Hong Kong. The plane \\nwas due to leave the airport at 8-30 a.m. The appel\\xad\\nlant had to go through the customs formalities before \\nhe could board the plane. On an enquiry by the \\nCustoms Officers as to w hct her he had any other \\narticles besides what he had declared in the declara\\xad\\ntion form, the appellant answered in the negative. \\nHis baggage was then examined but no objectionable \\narticle was detected therein. The Cwitoms Officers, \\nhowever, noticed a pouch of somewhat unusual -size· \\nwhich aroused their suspicion. Thereafter, the appel\\xad\\nlant was subjected to personal search. When they \\nwere about to search his person he let drop his \\ntrousers. The appellant was requested to lift up the \\ntrousers and wear them again which he did. On the \\nsearch of the trousers a sum of Rs. 25,000 in Indian \\ncurrency notes was discovered in two secret pockets. \\nThey were concealed from below the surface and \\nopened from the inside. On September 11, 1952, the \\nReserve Bank of India authorized Inspector S. B. \\nMitra of the Special Police Establishment, Calcutta, to \\nmake a representation to the Additional District \\nMagistrate, 24 Parganas (hereinafter referred to as the \\nAddtiona1 District Magistrate) for permission to \\nproceed against the appellant as required under \\ns. 19(3) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947. \\nMitra thereupon applied to the Additional District, \\nMagistrate on September 16, 1952, for a search warrant I959 \\nNarayandas \\nBhagwandas \\nJY!adltavda< \\nv. \\nThe State of \\nWest Bengal \\nImam].

Mitra on the same \\ndate also applied to the same Magistrate that a \\nwarrant of arrest might be issued against the appel\\xad\\nlant. This was also allowed and a warrant of arrest \\nwas issued by the Additional District Magistrate and \\nappellant was thereafter :irrested and released on bail \\nwith a direction to a ppcnr before the Additional Dis\\xad\\ntrict Magistrate on Septmnber 19. On September 19, he \\nwas released on bail by the Additional District Magis\\xad\\ntrate in the sum of Rs. 50,000 with 10 sureties of \\nRs. 5,000 each. On November 19, the appellant asked \\nfor exemption from atteri<ling the court on the succes\\xad\\nsive dates fixed for the ease but the application was \\nrefused. On January 27, 1953, the Reserve Bank of \\nIndia ftuthorized i\\\\litra to filn a com plftint against the \\nappellant. On :U\\'ehruary 2, 1953, a complaint was filed \\nagainst the appellant charging him with an offence \\nnnder s. 8(2) of the :Foreign Exchange Hegulation Act \\nreal\\'.l with s. 19 of the Sea ( \\\\1stoms Act and Notification \\nNo. FERA 105/55 H.B, <lated February 27, 1951. \\nThereafter, the appellant was tried by another \\nMagistrate, Mr. Sinha, who acquitted him under s. 258 \\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure. The currency \\nnotes which hn.d been seized by the Customs Officials \\nwere directed to be relassed. Against the appellant\\'s \\nacquittal the State of \\\\Vest Bengal preferred an \\nttppeal to the High Court. The High Court allowed \\nthe appeal and convicted the appellant of the offence \\nwith which he had b;;en charged. He was sentenced \\nto pay a fine of Rs. l,OOQ, in default to suffer rigorous \\nimprisonment for three months. The order of the \\nMagistrate directing the release of the currency notes \\nwas set aside. \\nThe main submission made on hehalf of the \\nappellant before 11s has been that the Additional \\nl>istric:t Magistrate Jrnving taken congnizance of the \\noffonee on l\\'cpt.em her Hl, 1952, and as the provisions of \\ns. 23(:l) of the For<,ign Exc:hange Regulation Act had \\nnot hcmn <:ompliccl with, the Pntire proceedings before \\nhim an cl I he i\\\\lagistrafo who tried the case were wit.bout \\njurisclietion. The subsequent aut:horization hy the \\nltescrvc Bank on January 27, l!J53, and the filing of S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 97 \\nthe complaint on February 2,1953,could not make legal \\nproceedings which had already commenced without \\njurisdiction. It was also urged that the facts found \\ndid not attract the provisions of s. 19 of the Sea Cus\\xad\\ntoms Act (8 of 1878) as it could not be said that at the \\nmoment the appellant was searched by the Customs \\nOfficials, he was taking out of India across any customs \\nfrontier as defined by the Central Government the cur\\xad\\nrency notes in question. It was also urged that explana\\xad\\ntion offered by the appellant was accepted by the \\ntrying Magistrate and the High Court ought not to \\nhave set aside the acquittal of the appellant, there \\nbeing no good ground why his explanation should not \\nhave been accepted. \\nThe version of the appellant as to how the sum of \\nRs. 25,000 in currency notes was with him was that \\nhe was not searched at all at the Customs barrier. He \\nhad taken out the currency notes in question from his \\ntrouser pocket and handed over the same to the Cus\\xad\\ntoms Officers stating the circumstances under which \\nhe was carrying the same on his person and asked for \\na receipt. The Customs Officers instead of giving him a \\nreceipt falsely charged him with smuggling the currency \\nnotes out of India without any permit. According to \\nthe appellant, he had applied to the Reserve Bank of \\nIndia at Calcutta for a permit and had sent an a pplica\\xad\\ntion for that purpose to one Joshi in Calcutta. He \\nfailed to receive the permit upto the last moment. \\nHis intention was to hand over the money to the Cus\\xad\\ntoms Officers for safe custody. In other words, the \\nappellant\\'s version, in substance, was that as he had \\nfailed to get the permit upto the last moment he vol\\xad\\nuntarily handed over the currency notes in question to \\nthe Customs Officers at the customs barrier· for safe \\nkeeping. He had at no time any intention to carry \\nout of India the said currency notes without a permit. \\nThis version of the appellant was accepted by the try\\xad\\ning Magistrate who acquitted him. The High Court, \\nhowever, did not accept his version. \\nIt was urged that the appeal is before us on a certific\\xad\\nate apd as the High Conrt had come to a different \\nI~ I959 \\nNarayandas \\nBhagwandas \\nMadhavdas \\nv. \\nThe State of \\nWest Bengal \\nImam]. \\'959 \\nNarayandas \\nBhagwandas \\nMadhavdas \\nv. \\nThe Stale of \\nWest Bengal \\nImam]. 98 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] \\nfiinding on a question of fact to what the trying Magi\\xad\\nstrate had found, it was open to the appellant to urge \\nthat he was entitled to question the findings of the \\nHigh Court. It is true that the High Court has taken \\na different view to that taken by the trying Magistrate \\nand has rejected the appellant\\'s case that he had vol\\xad\\nuntarily handed over the currency notes in question to \\nthe Customs Officers in the circumstances mentioned \\nby him and that he had no intention to take that \\nmoney out of India without a permit. Nonetheless, \\nthe finding of the High Court is on a question of fact. \\nWe can see no particular reason in this case to go be\\xad\\nhind the findings of fact arrived at by the High Court. \\nThe High Court gave very good reasons for accepting \\nthe evidence of the prosecution witnesses as to the \\ncircumstiinces in which the currency notes in question \\nwere recovered from the appellant when his person was \\nsearched. An important circumstance which might \\nhave supported the appellant\\'s case, namely whether \\nhe had applied to the Reserve Bank of India for a per\\xad\\nmit to take out of India currency notes to the extent \\nof Rs. 25,000 was considered by the High Court. It \\nfound, on the evidence of the Superintendent of the \\nReserve Bank, that the Reserve Bank received no \\napplication from the appellant before September 7, \\n1952, nor had the Reserve Bank granted the permission \\nto the appellant to take any currency notes out of India. \\nIt was on September 16, that the Reserve Bank had \\nreceived an application of the appellant forwarded by \\none G.C. ,Joshi by his letter dated September 15, 1952. \\nThe application of the appellant bore the date \\nSeptember 2, 1952. The High Court thought that \\nthere were grounds for suspecting that this applic\\xad\\nation was-antedated. The High Court came to the \\nconclusion that there was no evidence to show; that \\nany such application was writen or submitted on Sep\\xad\\ntember 2, 1952. It does seem extraordinary that if \\nthe appellant had sent the application to Joshi on \\nSeptember 2, 1952, that Joshi should not have sent on \\nthat application to the Reserve Bank till September 15, \\n1952. It is to be remembered that the incident had \\nalready taken place on September 7, 1952, and in that S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 99 \\nconnection on September 15 and 16, 1952, Inspector \\nMitra of the Special Police Establishment, Calcutta \\nhad applied for a search warrant and a warrant i;if ar\\xad\\nrest respectively against the appellant. On arrest, under \\nthe terms of that warrant he was released on bail by \\nthe police with a direction to appear before the court on \\nSeptember 19. The appellant had therefore ample \\nopportunity to concoct an application for a permit after \\nSeptember 7, and to antedate it getting Joshi on Sep\\xad\\ntember 15, 1952, to forward the same to the Reserve \\nBank. It is inconceivable that a person who was leav\\xad\\ning for Hong Kong and wished to carry such a large \\nsum of money as Rs. 25,000 in currency notes would \\nhave applied on September 2, when he was actually to \\nfly on September 7, 1952. Further it would not be \\nunreasonable to suppose that the appellant would have \\nso timed his arrival at Calcutta as would have enabled \\nhim to make the necessary enquiries from Joshi or the \\nReserve Bank whether the permit asked for had been \\ngranted. It is impossible to believe that he had arrivea \\nat Calcutta and had gone direct to the Dum Dum Aero\\xad\\ndrome without making any enquiry from Joshi at least \\nwhether the permit asked for had been granted. Norm\\xad\\na.lly one would expect the appellant to reach Calcutta. \\nin sufficient time to make the necessary enquiries \\nand in the absence of a permit having been granted to \\nhave left the currency notes for safe custody with Joshi \\nor some other trusted person. It is an entirely unaccept\\xad\\nable story which the appellant put forward that he \\nwaited upto the last moment at the aerodrome for the \\nnecessary permit and not having got it requested the \\nCustoms Officers to keep the currency notes for safe \\ncustody. It is significant that the appellant did not \\nexamine Joshi as a witness in support of his case. It is \\nnot uv!ikely that if he had done so some inconvenient \\nresults would have followed in consequence of.close \\nquestioning of Joshi regarding\\' the entire transaction. \\nWe have, therefore, no reason to think that the High \\nCourt had erred in suspecting that the application to \\nthe Reserve Bank was antedated. On this finding it \\nis apparent that the very foundation of the defence of \\nthe appellant is false.

We are satisfied that the finding of the \\nHigh Court is the only view which could reasonably \\nbe taken in a case like this. \\nIt is true that the appellant had not taken the \\ncurrency notes in question out of India across any \\ncustoms frontier as defined by the.Central Government. \\nHe had, however, clearly attempted to take the same \\nout of India. In such a case no question of his crossing \\nthe customs frontier arises. That an attempt to take \\nout the currency notes in question is an offence \\npunishable under the Sea Customs Act is clear from \\nthe provisions of s. 167, Item 8. The Foreign Exchange \\nRegulation (Amendment) Act l!J52 (VIII of 1952), came \\ninto force in :February 1952.

Furthermore, this point was not taken \\nbefore the Bench which granted the certificate of \\nfitness for appeal to this Court. Be that as it may, tlie \\nfacts found clearly established that the appellant \\nattempted to take out of India the currency notes in \\nquestion. He -had entered the customs enclosure and \\nhad signed the declaration form. He had been \\nquestioned as to whether he had any other article than \\nthose mentioned in the declaration form which he \\nwished to declare and he had answered in the negative. \\nOn his personal search he dropped his trousers on the \\nground. He was asked to pick up his trousers and \\nwear them again. On search of the trousers Rs. 25,000, S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 101 \\nin currency notes were found concealed in the inner \\npockets. The appellant had his ticket to procf.led to \\nHong Kong by a plane which was due to leave Dum \\nDum Airport at 8-30 a.m. and the customs formalities \\nwere done in connection with that flight. If the \\nappellant had successfully cleared himself from the \\ncustoms formalities all that•was left for him to do was \\nto board the plane which would take him 011t of India. \\nThese circumstances establish beyond all reasonable \\ndoubt that the act of the appellant had gone beyond \\nthe stage of preparation and was clearly an attempt to \\ncarry the sum of Rs. 25,000, in currency notes out of \\nIndia without a permit from the Reserve Bank. We \\ncannot accept the argument made on his behalf that \\nthe act of the appellant, on the fact~ found, amounted \\nmerely to preparation 11.nd not an attempt. \\nThe main submission on behalf of the appellant was \\ndirected towards establishing that the entire proceed: \\nings before the Additional District Magistrate and the \\ntrying Magistrate were without jurisdiction as cogniz\\xad\\nance of the offence had been taken on September 16, \\n1952, in contravention of the provisions of s. 23(3) of \\nthe ]foreign Exchange Regulation Act, there being on \\nthat date no complaint in writing made by an officer \\nauthorised in that behalf by the Central Government \\nor the Reserve Bank of India by a general or a special \\norder. It is, therefore, necessary to\\'see, in the circum\\xad\\nstances of the present case, on what date cognizance of \\nthe offence was taken. In order to ascertain this certain \\nprovisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act \\nand the Code of Criminal Procedure will require con\\xad\\nsideration. Under s. 19(3) of the Foreign Exchange \\nRegulation Act a District Magistrate or Magistrate of \\nthe first class may, on a representation in writing m.ade \\nby a person authorized in this behalf by the Central \\nGovernment or the Reserve Bank and having reasons \\nto believe that there had been contravention of any of \\nthe provisions of that Act, issue a search warrant. \\nInspector Mitra was so authorized by the Reserve Bank \\ntm September 11, 1952, and in pursuance of that \\nauthorization applied to the Additional District \\nMagistrate for the issue of a ·search warrant.

On \\nSeptember 16, Mitra applied for a warrant of arrest \\nagainst the appellant. This application was obviously \\nmade under the Criminal Procedure Code. The offence \\nwhich the appellant id alleged to have committed was a \\nnon-cognizable offence. Under s. 155(2) of the Code of \\nCriminal Procedure, no police officer shall investigate \\na non-cognizable offence without the order of a Magi\\xad\\nstrate of the first or second class having power to try \\nsuch a case or commit the same for trial, or of a Presid\\xad\\nency Magistrate. Inspector Mitra\\'s application \\ndefinitely states that he in asking for permission to \\ninvestigate a non-cognizable offence under s. 155, \\nCr. P.C. The order of the Additional District Magistrate \\ndirecting the issue of a search warrant and the word \\n\" permitted \" contained t,herein we consider, in the \\ncontext of the application, to mean that he granted \\nthe sanction for investigation as asked for. Under \\ns. 155(3) of the Code a police officer being permitted to \\ninvestigate a non-cognizable offence may exercise the \\nsame powers in respect of the investigation as an officer \\nincharge of a police station may exercise in a cogniz\\xad\\nable case, e}\\\\,cept that he has not the power to arrest \\nwithout a warrant. It was necessary therefore for \\nInspector Mitra to obtain from the Additional District \\nMagistrate a warrant of arrest. It is clear, therefore, \\nthat upto September 16, 1952, the Additional District \\nMagistrate had not taken cognizance of any offence. \\nOn September 19, 1952, the appellant appeared \\nbefore the Additional District Magistrate who recorded \\nthe following order :-\\n\" He is to give bail of Rs. 50,000 with ten sureties \\nof Rs. 5,000 each. Seen Police report. Time allowed \\ntill 19th November, 1952, for completing investigation.\" \\nOn November 19, 1952, on perusal of the police \\nreport the Magistrate allowed further time for investiga\\xad\\ntion until January 2, 1953, and on that date time was \\nfurther extended to February 2, 1953. In the mean\\xad\\ntime, on January 27, 1953, Inspector Mitra had been \\nauthorized under s. 23(3)(b) of the ]foreign Exchange \\nRegulation Act to file a complaint. Accordingly, a. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 103 \\ncomplaint was filed on February 2, 1953. The Additional \\nDistrict Magistrate thereon recorded the following order: \\n\"Seen the complaint filed to day against the \\naccused Narayandas Bhagwandas Madhavdas under \\nsection 8(2) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act \\nread with Section 23B thereof read with Section 19 of \\nthe Sea Customs Act and Notification No. ]\\'.E.R.A. \\n105/51 dated the 27th February, 1951, as amended, \\nissued by the Reserve Bank of India under Section \\n8(2) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act.

Accused to appear before him.\" \\nAccordingly, on the same date Mr. Sinha then \\nrecorded the following order :-\\n\" Accused present. Petition filed for reduction of \\nbail. Considering all facts, bail granted for Rs. 25,000 \\nwith 5 sureties. \\nTo 26th March, 1952 and 27th March, 1952 for \\nevidence.\" \\nIt is clear from these orders that on September 19, \\n1952, the Additional District Magistrate had not taken \\ncognizance of the offence because he had allowed the \\npolice time till November 19, 1952, for completing the \\ninvestigation. By his subsequent orders time for \\ninvestigation was further extended until February 2, \\n1953. On that date the complaint was filed and the \\norder of the Additional District Magistrate clearly \\nindicated that he took cognizance of the offence and \\nsent the case for trial to Mr. Sinha. It would also \\nappear from the order of Mr. Sinha that if the Ad\\xad\\nditional District Magistrate did not take cognizance, he \\ncertainly ciid because he considered whether the bail \\nshould be reduced and fixed the 26th and 27th of \\nMarch, for evidence. It was, however, argued that \\nwhen Mitra applied for a search warrant on Septem\\xad\\nber, 16, 1952, the Additional District Magistrate had \\nrecorded an order thereon, \" Permitted. Issue search \\nwarrant.\" It was on this date that the Additional \\nDistrict Magistrate took cognizance of the offence. We \\ncannot agree with this submission because the petition \\nof Inspector Mitra clearly states that \" As this is non\\xad\\ncognize.ble offence, I Pf.!LY that you will kindly permit I959 \\nNarayandas \\nBhagwandas \\nMadhavdas \\nv. \\nThe State of \\nWest Bengal \\nImam].

C.\" \\nThat is to say, that the Additional District Magistrate \\nwas not being asked to take cognizance of the offence. \\nHe was merely requested to grant permission to the \\npolice officer to investigate a non-cognizable offence. \\nThe petition requesting the Additional District. Magi\\xad\\nstrate to issue a warrant of arrest and his order directing \\nthe issue of such a warrant cannot also be regarded \\nas orders which indidate that the Additional District \\nMagistrate thereby took cognizance of the offence. It \\nwas clearly stated in the petition that for the purposes \\nof investigation his presence was necessary. The step \\ntaken by Inspector Mitra was merely a step in the \\ninvestigation of the case. He had not himself the \\npower to make an arrest having regard to the provi\\xad\\nsions of s. 155(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. \\nIn order to facilitate his investigation it was necessary \\nfor him to arrest the appellant and that he could not \\ndo without a warrant of arrest from the Additional \\nDistrict Magistrate. As already stated, the order of \\nthe Additional District Magistrate of September 19, \\n1952, makes it quite clear that he was still regarding \\nthe matter as one under investigation. It could not be \\nsaid with any good reason that the Additional District \\nMagistrate had either on September 16, or at any sub\\xad\\nsequent date upto February 2, 1953, applied his ·mind to \\nthe case with a view to issuing a process against the \\nappellant. The appellant had appeared before the \\nMagistrate on February 2, 1953, and the question of \\nissuing summons to him did not arise. The Additional \\nDistrict Magistrate, however, must be regarded as \\nhaving taken cognizance on this date because he sent \\nthe case to Mr. Sinha for trial. There was no legal \\nbar to the Additional District Magistrate taking cogniz\\xad\\nance of the offence on February 2, 1953, as on that \\ndate Inspector Mitra\\'s complaint was one which he \\nwas authorized to make by the Reserve Bank under \\ns. 23(3)(b) of the Foreign •Exchange Regulation Act. It \\nis thus clear to us that on a proper reading of the \\nvarious orders made by the Additional District Magi\\xad\\nstrate no cognizance of the offence was taken until \\nFebruary 2, 1953. The argument that he took cogniz\\xad\\nance of the offence on September 16, 1952, is without S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 105 \\nfoundation. The orders passed by the Additional \\nDistrict Magistrate on September 16, 1952, Se~tember \\n19, 1952, November 19, 1952, and January 2, 1953, \\nwere orders passed while the investigation by the \\npolice into a non-cognizable offence was in progress. If \\nat the end of the investigation no complaint had been \\nfiled against the appellant the police could have under \\nthe· provisions of s. 169 of the Code released him on · \\nhis executing a bond with or without sureties to \\nappear if and when so required before the Additional \\nDistrict Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of \\nthe offence on a police report and to try the accused or \\ncommit him for trial. The Magistrate would not be \\nrequired to, pass any further. orders in the matter. \\nIf, on the other hand, after completing the investig\\xad\\nation a complaint was filed, as in this case, it would be \\nthe duty of the Additional District Magistrate then to \\nenquire whether the complaint had been filed with the \\nrequisite authority of the Reserve Bank as required by \\ns. 23(3)(b) of the ]\\'oreign Exchange Regulation Act. It \\nis only at this stage that the Additional District Magis\\xad\\ntrate would be called upon to make up his mind whether \\nhe would take cognizance of the offence. If the complaint \\nwas filed with the authority of the Reserve Bank, as \\naforesaid, there would be no legal bar to the Magistrate \\ntaking cognizance. On the other hand, if there was no \\nproper authorization to file the complaint as required by \\ns. 23 the Magistrate concerned would be prohibited \\nfrom taking cognizance. In the present case, as the \\nrequisite authority had been granted by the Reserve \\nBank on January 27, 1953, to file a complaint, the \\ncomplaint filed on February 2, was one which complied \\nwith the provisions of s. 23 of the ]foreign Exchange \\nRegulation Act and the Additional District Magistrate \\ncould take cognizance of the offence which, indeed, he \\ndid on that date. The following observation by Das \\nGupta, J., in the case of S\\'uperintendent and Remem\\xad\\nbrancer of Legal Affairs, West Bengal v. Abani Kumar \\nBanerji (1) was approved by this Court in the case of \\nR.R. Chari v. The State of UUar Pradesh (2) :-\\n(1) A.I.R.

It seems to us, how\\xad\\never, that that makes no difference. It is the prin\\xad\\nciple which was enunciated by Das Gupta, J., which was \\napproved. As to when cognizance is taken of an \\noffence will depend upon the facts and circumstances \\nof each case and it is impossible to attempt to define \\nwhat is meant by taking cognizance. Issuing of a \\nsearch warrant for the purpose of an investigation or \\nof a warrant of arrest for that purpose cannot by \\nthemselves be regarded as acts by which cognizance \\nwas taken of an offence. Obviously, it is only when a \\nMagistrate applies his mind for the purpose of proceed\\xad\\ning under s. 200 ~nd subsequent sections of Chapter \\nXVI of the Code of Criminal Procedure or under s. 204 \\nof Chapter XVII of the Code that it can be positively \\nstated that he had applied his mind and therefore had \\ntaken cognizance. \\nIn our opinion, the proceedings before the Additional \\nDistrict Magistrate and the trying Magistrate were \\nwith jurisdiction and the trial of the appellant was \\nlegal. \\nThe appool is accordingly dismissed.

The Judgment of the Court was \\ndelivered by \\nWANCHoO J.-This is an appeal by special leave in \\nan industrial matter. The appellant is the Graham \\nTrading Co. (India) Ltd. (hereinafter called the \\ncompany). There was a dispute between the company \\nand its workmen about bonus, which was referred by \\nthe Government of West Bengal by its order of \\nDecember 17, 195:J: to the Second lndust.rial Tribunal. \\nThough the order of reference did not specify the year \\nfor which the bonus was in dispute, it is common \\nground between the •parties that the dispute was for \\nbonus for the ·year 1953. The case of the workmen, \\nwho a.re respondents before us, was that the company \\nha:d been paying one month's bonus invariably from \\n1940 to 1950. In 1951, one month's bonus was paid \\nin October and half a month's further bonus was paid \\nin December. In 1952 one month's bonus was paid. \\nThe demand that the workmen made in their letter of \\nAugust 27, 1953, was for three month's bonus. The \\n· company replied that payments in past years had been \\nentirely ex gratia and as there was loss in 1953 it was \\nnot possible to make any ex gratia payment that year. \\nThe workmen then contended in their letter of Septem\\xad\\nber 21, 1953 that the sole object of bonus which had, been \\ngranted upto that year was to meet puja expenses and \\nthat the payment of this bonus had become customary \\nand a term of employment. The matter could not be \\nsettled between the parties and that is how the dispute \\nwas referred for adjudication. \\nThe company's case was that payment of bonus had \\nall along been ex gratia depending upon profits except \\nin a few years. But in those years it was also made \\nclear that the payment was ex gratia and without \\ncreating any precedent for future. Therefore, there \\nwas neither a term of employment nor any custom, S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 109 \\nwhich put any. obligation on the company to pay any \\nbonus.in a year of loss. \\nThe quest.ion was considered by, the Industrial \\nTribunal from three aspects. Firstly, it considered \\nwhether any bonus was payable for this year as profit \\nbonus, on the basis of the :Full Bench formula evolved \\nin The Mill.Owners' Association, Bombay, v. The \\nRashtriya Mill Mazdoor Sangh, Bombay (1) and it \\ncame to the conclusion that there was no available \\nsurplus of profit to justify such bQnus. It then con. \\nsidered the remaining two aspects, namely, whether \\npuja bonus could be awarded either as an implied \\nterm of employment according to the decision in \\nM ahalakshmi Cotton Mills Ltd., Calcutta v. M ahalakshmi \\nCotton Mills Workers' Union (g) or on the basis of \\ncustom. It seems to have mixed up the discussion on \\nthese aspects and having come to the conclusion that \\npuja bonus could not be awarded in this case on the \\nbasis of an implied term of employment it proceQded \\nto dismiss the claim on the basis of custom also. \\nThe workmen then went up in appeal to the Labour \\nAppellate Tribunal, which allowed the appeal. The \\ndecision of the Appellate Tribunal has also mixed the \\ntwo aspects of puja bonus, namely, whether it is based \\non an implied term of employment or on custom; but \\nit came to the conclusion that there was sufficient \\nevidence to establish custom and therefore ordered \\npayment of one month's basic wages as puja bonus. It \\nwas also inclined to the view that the company's \\naccounts showing loss were not reliable and there might \\neven be a case for profit bonus; but eventually it \\ngranted one month's basic wages as customary puja \\nbonus. Thereupon the company filed an application \\nfor special leave to appeal to this Court, which was \\nallowed; and that is how the matter has come up \\nbefore us. \\nPuja is a special festival of particular importance in \\nBengal ; and it has become usual with many firms there \\nto pay their employees bonus to meet special puja \\nexpenses. Disputes have arisen with respect to this bonus \\nwhich were adjudicated npon by various tribunals. As \\n(1) 1950 L.L.J. 1247. ( 2) 1952 L. A. C. 370.

As it was difficult for poorly paid employees \\nto make savings out of the monthly income for this \\npurpose, it, therefore, had become traditional and \\ncustomary in 'Bengal for employers to make a monetary \\ngrant at the time of the pujas. The Bengal Chamber of \\nCommerce had not been slow in appreciating this and \\nhad been granting bonus equivalent to one month's \\npay, and the tribunal had been assured that there was \\nno intention to discontinue it. Later the matter was \\nconsidered in Mahalaxmi Cottan Mills case('), where \\ncertain tests were laid down which would justify the \\ninference that there was an implied term of employ\\xad\\nment for payment of bonus at the time of the annual \\nDurga Puja. That case, however, was concerned with \\npuja bonus as an implied term of employment and not \\nas a matter of tradition or custom in Bengal. It is, \\nhowever, clear that puja bonus which is usually paid \\nin Bengal is of two kinds; namely, (1) where it is paid \\nas an implied term of employment as explained in \\nM ahalaxmi Cottan Mills case(') and (2) where it is paid \\nas a customary and traditional payment as stated in \\nthe Industrial Tribunal's award referred to above. \\nWe have considered the tests to be applied where it is \\na case of payment on an implied term of employment \\nin Messrs. Ispahani Ltd. v. Ispahani Employees' \\nUnion(') and we need not repeat what we have said \\nthere. In the present case it has been pointed out by \\nthe company that payments which had been made in \\nthe past years from 1940 to 1952 could not be con\\xad\\nsidered as based on an implied term 0£ employment in \\nthe circumstances of this case. This contention, in \\nour opinion, is correct. An implied term of employ\\xad\\nment cannot be inferred in this case, for right from \\n(I) Publication of Government of West Bengal, j Awards made by the \\nTribunals for the quarter ending March 1949', p. 116. \\n(2) 1952 L.A.C. 370. \\n(3) [1960(1)] S.C.R. 24. S.C.R SUPREME COUR'f REPORTS 111 \\n1948 to 1952, the company whenever it paid this \\nbonus, made it clear that it was an ex gratia payment \\nand would not constitute any precedent for future \\nyears. In the face' of such notice year by year it \\nwould not be possible to imply a term of employment \\non the basis of an implied agreement, for agreement \\npostulates a meeting of minds regarding the subject\\xad\\nmatter of an agreement; and here one party was \\nalways making it clear that the payment was ex gratia \\nand that it would not form a precedent for future \\nyears. In dealing with the question of an implied \\nterm of the condition of service, it would be difficult \\nto ignore the statement expressly made by the \\nemployer while making the payment from year to year. \\nThe question, however, whether the payment in this \\ncase was customary and traditional, still remains to be \\nconsidered. In dealing with puja bonus based on an \\n'implied term of employment, it was pointed out by us \\nin Messrs. lspahani Ltd. v. lspahani Employees' \\nUnion (1) that a term may be implied, even though the \\npayment may not have been at a uniform rate \\nthroughout and the Industrial Tribunal would be \\njustified in deciding what should be the quantum of \\npayment in a particular year taking into account the \\nvarying payments made in pr1;1vious years. But when \\nthe question of customary and traditional bonus arises \\nfor adjudication, the considerations may be somewhat \\ndifferent. In such a case, the Tribunal will have to \\nconsider: (i) whether the payment has been over an \\nunbroken series of years; (ii) whether it has been for a \\nsufficiently long period, though the length of the period \\nmight depend on the circumstances of each case : even \\nso the period may normally have to be longer to \\njustify an inference of traditional and customary puja. \\nbonus than may be the case with puja bonus based on \\nan implied term of employment; (iii) the circumstance \\nthat the payment depended upon the earning of profits \\nwould have to be excluded and therefore it must be \\nshown that payment was made in years of loss. In \\ndealing with the question of custom, the fact that the \\npayment was called ex gratia by the employer when it \\n(1) [1960(1)] S.C.R. 24. z959 \\nThe Gra/lam \\nTrading Co. \\n(India) Ltd. \\nv. \\nIts Workmen \\nWanchoo j. z959 \\nTh~Graham \\nTrading Co. \\n(India) Ltd. \\nv. \\nIts Workmen \\nwan&hoo ]. 112 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)) \\nwas made, would, however, make no difference in this \\nregard because the proof of custom depends upon the \\neffect of the relevant factors enumerated by us; and it \\nwould not be materially affected by unilateral declara. \\ntions of one party when the said declarations are \\ninconsistent with the course of conduct adopted by it ; \\nand (iv) the payment must have been at a uniform \\nrate throughout to justify an inference that the \\npayment at such and such rate had become customary \\nand traditional in the particular concern. It will be \\nseen that these tests are in substance more stringent \\nthan the tests applied for proof of puja bonus as an \\nimplied term of employment. \\nLet us now see whether these tests are satisfied in \\nthe present case. The practice in the present case \\nbegan in 1940 and was unbroken upto 1950. In \\nbetween there was an adjudication in 1948 to which \\nthe company was a party. At that time it was said \\non behalf of the company before the industrial \\ntribunal that some bonus was being paid and that \\nthere was no intention to discontinue it and conse\\xad\\nquently .the tribunal did not adjudicate upon the \\nmatter, which shows that the company recognised the \\ntraditional and customary nature of the payment and \\nit assured the tribunal that there was no intention \\nthen to discontinue the payment. The payment was \\ncontinued from 1949 to 1951. In 1952, there was some \\ndispute and originally the company paid one month's \\nwages as advance of pay and not as bonus. Some of \\nthe workmen, however, accepted the payment while \\nothers did not, because they were not satisfied with \\nthe amount being paid as advance of pay. The \\nchairman of the board of directors of the company \\nvisited Calcutta in 1952 and then on the represehtation \\nof the workmen the advance was converted into one \\nmonth's bonus and even those workmen who had not \\naccepted the advance were allowed to draw the bonus. \\nIt cannot therefore be said that there was any break \\nin the payment of bonus from 1940 to 1952, for if the \\nchairman had not converted what was advance of pay \\ninto bonus in December 1952, the workmen might \\nha. ve raised the dispute even in tha.t year a.nd then S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 113 \\nthere would have been no break up to 1951. So there \\nhas been unbroken payment and the period has been \\nsufficiently long to justify an inference of customary \\nand traditional bonus. It was pointed out that in \\nfour years during this period the payment was made \\nin November and December and not about the time of \\nthe pujas; and, therefore, it could not be said that \\nthis was traditional and customary puja bonus. The \\ndelay in payment is not in our opinion material in \\nthis case, for one of the directors of the company, who \\nappeared as a witness, stated as to this one month's \\nbonus that it was paid by the company to help its \\nstaff during pujas. \\nThe condition that the payment should have been \\nmade in years of loss also to exclude the hypothesis \\nthat it was paid only because profits had been made, \\nhas also been satisfied, for the evidence is that \\npayments were made in at least two years of loss. \\nLastly, the condition that payment should have been \\nat a uniform rate has also been satisfied because one \\nmonth's basic wage is the quantum of bonus from 1940 \\nright up to 1952 without any change. It is true that \\nin December 1951 further bonus for half a month was \\npaid; but that year was a year of profit in which \\ncloth-bonus for half a month was specially paid. Thus \\nthe rate so far as the puja bonus is concerned has \\nalways remained uniform at one month's basic wage. \\nIt is true that the workmen pitched their demand too \\nhigh for three month's bonus in 1953. But that does \\nnot in our opinion detract from the inference to be \\ndrawn from the facts proved in this case. All the \\nconditions, therefore, of a customarv and traditional \\nbonus are satisfied in this case and there is no reason \\nto interfere with the order of the Appellate Tribunal, \\nthough we should like to make it clear that we do not \\nagree with the observations of the Appellate Tribunal \\nin connection with the profit bonus aspect of the \\nmatter. The appeal therefore fails and· is hereby \\ndismissed. As this question has arisen for tlie first \\ntime in this Court as a distinct issue and was not \\nclearly considered before by the Appellate Tribunal, \\nwe order the parties to bear their own costs. \\n15 Appeal dismissed.

This notice was published on or \\n- about Mav l, l!J45. The assessee dicl not make a \\nreturn of );is income. The Income-tax Officer, \\\\vhile \\nexamining the books of account of a partnership called \\nthe \"Assar Svndic11te\" of which the assessee was a. \\npartner, founci that in the account year corresponding \\nto the assessment year 1945-46, there were six cash \\ncredits aggregating to Rs. 59,026 in the name of the \\nassessee\\'s wife. Before, however, the Income-tax 116 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] \\nr959 Officer could take any action, the assessee submitted a -. . \"voluntary\" return on January 5, 1950 of his income \\nTh~, c1°\"\\'\"\\'\"\\'1\\'°\"\" for the accounting year 1944-45 (assessment year o; ncome· ax, h . . \\nBombay 1945-46) s owmg a total net mcome of Rs. 1,935. He \\nv. added a footnote to the return to the following effect : \\nRanchhoddas \"My wife has sold her old ornaments and deposit-\\nKarsondas, Bombay ed the sum of Rs. 59,026 in the firm of Assar Syndi-\\nHidayatullah J. cate in which I am a partner.\" \\nThe Income-tax Officer did not act on this return, \\nbut on February 27, 1950 he issued a notice purporting \\nto be under s. 34 of the Act calling upon the assessee \\nto submit his return. This notice was served on the \\nassessee on March 3, 1950; and in answer thereto, the \\nassessee submitted a simifar return on March 14, 1950 \\nshowing the same income and adding the same foot\\xad\\nnote. The Income-tax Officer then issued and served \\nupon the assessee notices under ss. 22( 4) and 23(2) of \\nthe Act asking him to produce his books of account \\nand to tender any evidence he cared to lead. It \\nappears from the record that these notices were compli\\xad\\ned with, but on February 26, 1951 the Income-tax \\nOfficer included the sum of Rs. 59,026 in the total in\\xad\\ncome of the assessee and assessed him on it for the \\nassessment year 1945-46. \\nThe assessee appealed, in turn, to the Appdlate \\nAssistant Commissioner and the Income-tax Appt;llate \\nTribunal. His contentions were three, viz., that the \\namount of Rs. 59,026 could not and should not have \\nbeen included in his income, that the amended s. 34 of \\nthe Act had no retrospective effect, and that the \\nassessment completed on February 26, 1951 was in\\xad\\nvalid, inasmuch as it was completed four years after \\nthe end of the relevant assessment year. Both the \\nAppellate Assistant Commissioner as well as the Tri\\xad\\nbunal rejected his contentions, but the Tribunal on \\nbeing moved by him, raised and referred two questions \\nof law under s. 66(1) of the Act to the High Court of \\nJudicature, Bombay, for its decision. These questions \\nwere:· \\n\"(1) Whether the notice issued under Section 34 \\nof the Act by the Income-tax Officer on 27-2-1950, S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 117 \\nafter the assessee had filed a voluntary return was r959 \\nvalid in law ? Th c · · \\n(2) Wh I h d 26 2 191\\':.} • e omnnsstnner et ier t e assess1nent. n1a e on - -o IS Df Income-tax, \\nvalid in law ? \" Hom/){ly \\nThis reference was heard by the High Court on v. \\nMarch 18, 1954, and by a judgment delivered on the . Ranchhoddas \\nsame day, Chagla, C,J., and Tcndolkar, J., answered 1\\'arsondas, Bombay \\nboth the questions in the negative. Before the High llida_;.:;-:;1ah, J. \\nConrt, it was again contended by the assessee that \\nsince he had submitted a return under s. 22(3) of the \\nAct on January 5, 1950, the assessment, if any, had \\nto be completed before March 31, 1!)50, as required by \\ns. 34(3) of the Act. He alRo contended that he was \\nentitled under s. 22(3) to make [t \" voluntary\" return \\non the date he did, and with a voluntary return before \\nthe Income-tax Officer, there was no scope for the \\nissuance of a notice under s. 34. The High Court up-\\nheld the contentions of the asi.;essee, and gave its \\nopinion that the Department ought to have issued a \\nnotice under s. 22(2) within the assessment year, and \\nif no return was made within the time fixed by the \\nnotice; the Department 8hould have proceeded under \\ns. 23(4) to a \\'best judgment\\' assessment. The other \\nalter1iative for the Department was to issue a notice \\nunder s. 34 of the Act, if the period for sending a \\nnotice under s. 22(2) had expired. But it could not \\nissue a notice under s. 34 after a return was already \\nmade before it, and the benefit of the extended period \\nof limitation for assessment available under the first \\nproviso to sub-s. (3) of s. 34 of one year from the \\nservice of the notice under snh-s. (I) of that section was \\nnot available in this case. The High Court granted a \\ncertificate of fitness, and hence this appeal. \\nThe arguments which were urged before the High \\nCourt were all raised in this Court by the parties. The \\ncase of the Department was supplemented by ar \\nargument that, inasmuch as the assessee had suppress\\xad\\ned his income or given incorrect particulars thereof, \\nthe period during which action under s. 34 could be \\ntaken was the extended one of 8 years. \\nIn the arguments before us, our attention was drawn \\nto a cleavage of opinion between the Bombay High ll8 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] \\n\\'959 Court on the one lmnd and the Calcutta High Court on \\n--: . the other. \\\\Vhile the Bombay High Court seems to be \\nThr Commimnner of the view that. a \"voluntary\" return showing a non-\\nof lncome-tflx, .. 1 · · \\'II d t ,. II Bombav taxau e moome is st1 a goo re .urn ior a purposes \\nv. · under the Act, the Calcutta High Court is of the view \\nRanchhoddas that whats. 22(1) of the Act requires is a return of \\nKarsnndas, ~nmhay taxable income and not a return of income, which \\n·a -\\n11 h 1 shows a loss 01· 18 below ihe taxable limit. It appears \\nHt ovatu • • h t . h (\\' l H\\' ] C I . · t a at one t.nne t e ~a rmtta 1g 1 ourt a so enter-\\ntained the view that such a, return was no return at all, \\nbut it was expl1tined later that this me,tnt that the \\nreturn was ineffective for the purposes of s. 22(1) of tlw \\nAct, though it might he IL \"return\" being in the \\nprescribed form. The Bombay High Court also enter\\xad\\ntains the view that the asse-ssment proceedings com\\xad\\nmence with the issue of \\'\\' public: notice, and that s. 34 \\nof the Act cannot apply, whero in answer to the publie \\nnotice a return is made whether of taxable income or \\nnot. The view of the Calcutta High Court is that \\nassessment proceedings commence either with a notice \\nunder s. 22(2) of the Art or with the filing of a return \\nshowing taxable income. \\nWe are not here concerned with the quantum hut \\nonly with the legality oHhe assessment. The side issue \\nwhether, in point of fact, the cash credits in the name \\nof the wife represented the income of the husband does \\nnot survive for decision. Thus, the only question is \\nwhether the notice issued under s. 34 of i;lie Act on \\nFebruary 27, l!l50 (after the assessee filed his \"vqlun\\xad\\ntary\" return on January 5, 1950) and the assessment \\nthereon, were valid in bw. Section 34(3) of the Act \\nprovides that no assessment except the assessm1mt \\nwithin cl. (a) of suh-s. (l) thereof or under s. 23 to which \\ncl. (c) of sub-s. (1) of s. 28 applies, shall be made after \\nthe expiry of four years from the encl of the year in \\nwhich income, profits or gains were first assessable. A \\nproviso, however, allows one year from the date of tlH> \\nservice of the notice for t.he completion of the assess\\xad\\nment. It reads, omitting matters not relevant here :-\\n\" ... where a notice under sub-section (1) has been \\nissued within the time therein limited, the assessment \\nor reassessment to he made in pursuance of such • \\'\\' S.C.R.

(1) of s. 34 has v. \\nbeen issued within the time therein limited. This takes Ranchlwddas \\nUS to s. 34( 1 ). Karsondas, Bombay \\nSectic;:m 34(1), omitting parts not relevant, reads:- Hidayatullali J. \\n\"(l) If ... \\n(a) the Income-tax Officer has reason to believe \\nthat.by reason of the omission or failure· on the part \\nof an assessee to make a return of his income under \\nsection 22, for any year ...... , or \\n(b) notwithstimrling that there has been no omis\\xad\\nsion or failure as mentioned in clause (a) on the part \\nof the assessee, the Income-tax Officer has in con\\xad\\nsequence of information in his possession reason to \\nbelieve that income, profits or gains chargeable to \\nincome-tax have escaped assessment for any year ... \\n* * * he may in cases falling under clause (a) at any time \\nwithin eight years and in cases falling under clause \\n(h) at any time \\'vithin four years of the end of that \\nyear, serve on the assessee ... a notice ... and may \\nproceed to assess such income ... \" \\nIt would appear from this that if the return filed on \\nJanuary 5, 1950, was a return of income, there was no \\nfailure or omission on the part of the asscssee, so as to \\nbring the matter within s. 34(l)(a) of the Act, and sub\\xad\\ns. (3) of s. 34 would then apply to the case limiting the \\nperiod to four years. In that event, the a:;sessmcnt \\nshould have been completed on or before March 31, \\n19b0. But if the return made by the assessee was no \\nreturn at all, then the conditions under the first sub\\xad\\nsection of s. 34 obtained, and the assessment could he \\ncompleted within one year of the date of service of the \\nnotice (l\\\\Iarch 3, 1950), i.e. on or before March 2, 1951. \\nIn that event, the asses:mient would be valid. The \\nvalidity of the return in this context is tied to the \\nvalidity of the notice and also i:ice versa. 120 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] \\n\\'959 Section 22 of tho Aet (omiUing the parts not relev-\\n--. . a.nt) may now be quoted : \\nli\" c1°\"111\"\"\\n1\\'°11\\'\\' \"(1) The Inuomo-tax Officer shall, on or before the \\no; nwme-ax, 1 t l f M \\' ] \\' t\\' b b]\\' Bombav s (a)\\' o l\\'v.iay, 111eac1 .~rear, g1\\\\7C no ice, y }lU · IC· \\nv. • ation iu the press ... , requiring every person whose \\nRanchhodda; total income during the previous year exceeded the \\n/(arwnda;, Bombay maximum amount which is not chargeable to \\nHidayatullah ]. income-tax to furnish, within such period not being \\nless than sixty days ... a return .. ., setting forth ... his \\ntotal income and tot.ti world income during that \\nyear: • * * (2) In the case of any person whose total income \\nis, in the Income-tax Officer\\'s opinion, of such an \\namount as to render such person liable to income\\xad\\ntax, the Income-tax Officer may serve a notice upon \\nhim requiring him to furnish, within such period, \\nnot being less than thirty days ... a return ... setting \\nforth . . . his total income and total world income \\nduring the prov ions year: • • • \\n(3) If any person has not furnished a return with\\xad\\nin the time allowed l1y or under sub-section (I) or \\nsub-section (2), or having furnished a return under \\neither of those sub-sections, discovers any omission \\nor wrong statement thprein, he may furnish a return \\nor a revised return, as the case may be at any time \\nbefore the assessment is made.\" \\nIt will be seen from this, that, as the Bombay High \\nCourt correctly pointed out, there is a time limit \\nprovided in sub-ss. (l) ti.ml (2) and the failure or omis\\xad\\nsion occurs when that period passes, but sub-s (3) \\n:;i,llows a locus poen:itentiae before the assessment is \\nactually made. There is no disput_e that a return could \\nbe filed in this case, late though it was. The con\\xad\\ntroversy centres round the fact that the return, when \\nit was filed, disclosed an income which was below the \\nmaximum not chargeable to tax, and the question is \\nwhether in such an event the Income-tax Officer was \\nprecluded from issuing a notice under s. 34 of the Act. \\nThere has been in the past a well-marked difference of \\nopinion between the Bombay and the Calcutta High S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 121 \\nCourts, the leading cases in Bombay being Harakchand i95~ \\nMakanji & Do. v. Oommiss-ioner of Income-tax (1), All The Commission\" \\nIndia Groundnut Syndicate Ltd. v. Commissioner of of Income-tu, \\nIncome-tax (2) and the decision under appeal here, while Bombay \\nthe Calcutta view is to be found in Commissioner of v. \\nAgricnltural Income-tax v. Sultan Ali Gharami (3) R. K. Ranchhoddas • . \\' Karsondas, Bombay Das & Go. v. Commissioner of Income-tax(•) and Com-\\nmissioner o.f Income-tax v. Govindlal Dutta e). To these Hiday~ah J. \\nmay be added P. S. Rlima Iyer v. C01nmi.ssioner of \\nIncome-tax (6), in which the Madras High Court has \\naccepted the Bombay view. \\nNo useful purpose will be served in discussing these \\ncases in detail. In some of them, the point need not \\nhave been taken up for decision, though it was. We \\nshall refer very briefly to the two rival views and the \\ngrounds on which they are rested, and in doing so, we \\nbegin with the Calcutta decisions. In Sultan Ali \\nGharami\\'s case (3), a notice under s. 24(1) of the Bengal \\nAgricultural Income-tax Act (corresponding to s. 22(1) \\nof the Act) was issued. No return was filed. Three \\nyears later, a notice under s. 24(2) of that Act \\n(corresponding to s. 22(2) of the Act) was served, and \\na return showing an income below the taxable \\nminimum was filed. The contention was that without \\na notice under s. 24(2) within the assessment year or a \\nnotice under s. 38(1) (corresponding to s. 34 (1) of the \\nAct) the \\'best judgment\\' assessment was bad. The \\ncontention further \\\\Vas that the return could be taken \\nto be under s. 24(1) or s. 24(3). Chakravarti, J.

SUPREME COURT REPORTS 123 \\nagain explained the true import of the law laid down. x959 \\nThey referred to s. 22(1) of the Act as it stood prior to Th c -. . e ommsssioner the amendment of 1953, and observed that under that 0, Incom6-tas \\nsection a person was required to file a return only if \\' Bombay \\nhis total income during the preceding year exceeded v. \\nthe maximum amount which was not chargeable to Ranchhoddas \\ntax. The return contemplated was thus only a return Karsondas, Bombt1y · \\nof income and not a return of loss and not even a Hidayatullt1h J. \\nreturn of income, but a return of taxable income. Not \\nonly had a person no duty but he\" had even .no right, \\nto file a return voluntarily, if he had suffered a loss, \\nto \\'report\\' that loss. The learned Judges concluded \\nthat it was a complete mistake to think that s. 22(3) \\nprovided for the filing of a voluntary return showing \\nloss, at any time, before assessment. That section, \\nthey opined, contemplated the filing of a return of \\ntaxable income, and a return not showing such income \\nwas not a return at all in law. \\nThe Calcutta view, as shown above, really proceeds \\nupon the wording of s. 22(1). It lays down that the \\npublic notice requires only persons having an income \\nabove the taxable limit to make a return. A person \\nwho has no such. income need not make a return, and \\nif he does make a return, it is not a return which need \\nbe considered, being not a return in law. \\nIt is a little difficult to understand how the exist\\xad\\nence of a return can be ignored, once it has been \\nfiled. A return showing income below the. taxable \\nlimit can be made even in answer to a notice under \\ns. 22(2). The notice under s. 22(1) requires in a \\ngeneral way what a notice under s. 22(2) requires of an \\nindividual. If a return of income below the taxable \\nlimit is a good return in answer to a notice under \\ns. 22(2), there is no reason to think that a return of a \\nsimilar kind in answer to a public notice is no return \\nat all. The conclusion does not follow from the words \\nof s. 22(1). No dout>t, under that sub-section only \\nthose persons a.re required to make a return, whose \\nincome is above taxable limits, but a person may \\nlegitimately consider himself entitled to certain deduc\\xad\\ntions and allowances, and yet file a return to be on \\nthe safe side. He may show his income and the 124 SUPREME COUii\\'l\\' REPORTS [1960(1}] \\n\\'959 deductions and allowances he claims. But it may be \\nT\\'\" c . . that on a correct processing his income may be found ~ om1niss1oner . . \\nof Incom•-tax, to be above the exempted hm1t, No doubt, it is futile \\nBombay. for a person not liable to tax· to rush in with a return, \\nv. but the return in law is not a mere scrap of paper. \\nRanchhoddas It is a return, such as the assessee considers, repre\\xad\\nKarsondas, Bombay sen ts his true income. \\nHidayat1.tlah J. We are unable (and we say this with due respect} \\nto accept the view ad,.umbrated in the Calcutta cases. \\nThe contrary \\\\7iew is expressed by the Bombay High \\nCourt in the earlier ca.se of Harakchand Makanji & Co. \\nv. Cornm·is.sioner of Incorne-tax (1) and in the judgment \\nunder appeal. That view was accepted by the Madras \\nHigh Court in P. S. Raina Iyer v. Cornrnissioner of \\nlncorne-tnx (\\') and also, in our opinion, is the sounder \\nview of the two. In the earlier of the two Bombay \\ncases, Chagla, C. J., and Tendolkar, J., held (as stated \\nin the head note) : \\n\"Notice under section 34 is only necessary if at \\nt.he end of the assessment year no return has been \\nmade by the assessee, and the authorities wished to \\nproceed under section 22(2), but where the assessee \\nhimself chooses voluntarily to make a return, no \\nquestion can arise under section 34 of assessment \\nescaping, and therefore there is no necessity to \\n8erve any notice under section 34.\" \\nThis represents the law applicable to the facts as they \\nare to be found in this case. In the assessment year \\nno return of income was filed, nor was any notice \\nserved under s. 22(2). There was, however, the general \\nnotice under s. 22(1). A return in answer to that \\nnotice could be filed under s. 22(3) before assessment, \\nand for this there is no limit of time. It was filed on \\nJanuary 5, 1950. Th\\'ere was nothing to prevent the \\nIncome-tax Officer from taking up the return and \\nproceeding to assess the income of the assessee. It \\nwas open to him, if there wa.s sufficient justification \\nfor it, to hold that the amount noted in the footnote \\nwas really the assessee\\'s income, in which case an \\nassessable income would have been found and the tax \\ncould be charged thereon. If the Income-tax Officer \\nhad acted on that return and assessed the assessee \\n(I) (1948) 161.T.R. ug. (2) (1957) 32 I. T.

The Commissioner on tie assessee a notwe ~n er s. . is notice of Income-ta~. \\nwas improper, because with the return already filed Bombay \\nthere was neither an omission nor a failure on the v. \\npart of the assessee, nor was there any question of Ranchkoddas \\nassessment \\'escaping\\'. The notice under s. 34(1) was, Karsondas,Bombay \\ntherefore, invalid and the consequent assessment H idayatullah ] • equally so. vVe accordingly agree with the judgment \\nunder appeal. \\nBefore leaving this case, we may refer to two other \\narguments, whieh were raised. Mr. Rajagopala Sastri \\npointed out that an assessee might file the \\'voluntary\\' \\nretw.rn on the last <lay showing income less than the \\ntaxable limit, and the· Department would, in that \\ncase, be driven to complete the assessment proceed\\xad\\nings within a few hours or lose the right to send a \\nnotice under s. 34(1). An argument ab inconvenienti \\nis not a decisive argument. The Income-tax Officer \\ncould have avoided the result by issuing a notice \\nunder s. 23(2) and not remaining inactive until the \\nperiod wa.s about to expire. :Further, all laws of \\nlimitation lead to some inconvenience and hard \\ncases. The remedy is for the legislature to amend\" \\nthe law suitably. The Courts can administer the laws \\nas they find them, and they are seldom required to \\nbe astute to de\\'feat the law of limitation. This argu\\xad\\nment is thus no answer to the dear meaning and· \\nimplications of the Act. \\nThe other argument was that the return was not \\na true one, and fell within the mischief of cl. (c) Of \\nsub-s.(l) of s. 28, and that, therefore, the period during \\nwhich action could be taken was the extended one \\nof 8 years. The short answer to that is that this was \\nnot a part of the Department\\'s case at any prior \\nstage, and cannot be allowed to be raised now. \\nIn our opinion, the answers given by the High \\nCourt of Bombay were correct in all the circumstances \\nof this case. \\nThe appeal thus fails, and is dismissed with costs. \\nAppeal dismissed.

The High Court was of \\nthe opinion that there was no misdirection in the \\nSessions Judge\\'s charge to the jury and we are in \\nagreement with the High Court. \\nWe have examined the charge to the jury. The \\nSessions Judge in dealing with the evidence of the \\napprover charged the jury as follows :-\\n\" Before doing so, some established legal principles \\nas regards the approver\\'s evidence and the confes\\xad\\nsions on which the prosecution has relied in the \\npresent case are required to be explained to you. \\nThe approver is a competent witness against an \\naccused person and although his evidence is strictly \\nadmissible and a conviction is not illegal, merely \\nbecause it is based. on approver\\'s evidence, it is a \\nsettled rule of practice not to convict a person on \\nsuch evidence except under very rare and excep\\xad\\ntional circumstanc~s. and usua!lv substantial cor\\xad\\nroboration is required. I, therefore, warn you, gentle\\xad\\nmen, that it is highly dangerous to convict on \\napprover\\'s evidence alone. There can, no doubt be \\na legal conviction upon the uncorroborated evi\\xad\\ndence of an accomplice and, as already stated, \\nthe uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice is \\nstrictly admissible and a conviction based on it alone \\nis not illegal, yet you should remember, gentlemen, \\nthat experience teaches us that an accomplice being \\nalways an infamous person, he having thrown to the \\nwolves his associates and friends in order to save his \\nown skin and, though criminal, has purchased his \\nliberty by betrayal, his evidence must be received \\nwith very great caution and it is highly dangerous \\nto act upon his evidence unless it is materially \\ncorroborated. I must also tell you that this rule as \\nto corroboration has become a settled rule of prac\\xad\\ntice of so universal an application that it has now \\nalmost the force and reverence of law. Corrobora\\xad\\ntion must be as to the crime and the identity of \\neach one of the accused and the corroboration requir\\xad\\ned must be independent evidence, that is reliable \\nevidence of another kind. S.O.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 129 \\nEvidence in corroboration must be independent \\ntestimony, which affects the accused by connecting \\nor tending to connect the accused with the crime. \\nIn other words, it must be evidence which implicates \\nhim, that is, which conforms in some material parti\\xad\\nculars not only the evidence that the crime has been \\ncommitted but also that the prisoner (accused) \\ncommitted it. Corroborative evidence, you should \\nbear in mind, is evidence which shows or tends to \\nshow that the story of the accomplice that the \\naccused committed the crime is true. The corrobor\\xad\\nation-need not be direct evidence that the accused \\ncommitted the crime. It would be sufficient if it is \\nmerely circumstantial evidence of his connection with \\nthe crime. The corroboration in material particulars \\nmust be such as to connept or indentify each of the \\naccused with the offence. In the present case, a \\nprevious statement of an approver, viz., the confes\\xad\\nsion has been made exhibit before you, but that \\nprevious statement, you are further to bear in mind, \\ncannot r.orroborate his latter statement, viz., the \\nstatements that have been made by him before you \\nin this Court. · \\nIn dealing with the question what amount of \\ncorroboration is required you, gentlemen, must exer\\xad\\ncise careful discrimination and look at all the \\nsurrounding circumstances in order to arrive at a \\nconclusion whether the facts deposed to by the \\napprover Sastipada are borne out by those circum-\\nstances. \" · \\nMr. Umrigar on behalf of the appellant urged that \\nthe aforesaid direction given by Sessions Judge to the \\njury was not sufficient. The jury should have been \\ntold (1) in accordance with the decision of this Court \\nin the case of Sarwan Singh v. The State of Punjab (1) \\nthat the approver\\'s evidence has to satisfy a double \\ntest. It must show that he is a reliable witness and \\nthat his evidence receives sufficient corroboration, (2) \\nthat the evidence of an approver must be confirmed \\nnot only as to the circumstances of the crime but also \\nas to the identity of the prisoner. The corrobor1~.tion \\n(1) (1957] S.C.R. 9S~· \\n17 I959 \\n] nanendra N alll \\nChose \\nv. \\nThe State of \\nWest Bengal \\nImsm], 1959 \\n]nanendra·Nath \\nGhose \\nv. \\nThe State of \\nWest Bengal \\nImam]. 130 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] \\nought to consist in circumstances that affects the \\nidentity of the party accused. Reliance was placed \\non the case of The King v. Baskerville (1), (3) that the \\ncircumstantial evidence corroborating the approver \\nwas not sufficient to connect the appellant with the \\nmurder of the deceased and (4) that on similar corrobor\\xad\\nation of the approver\\'s testimony the accused J agdish \\nGorain had been acquitted. There was no real distinc\\xad\\ntion between the case of J agdish Gorain and the \\nappellant. \\nIt is true that in Sarwan Singh\\'s case this Court had \\nheld, \"The appreciation of an approver\\'s evidence \\nhas to satisfy a double test. It must show that he is a \\nreliable witness and that his evidence receives suffici\\xad\\nent corroboration and that is a test which is common \\nto all witnesses. If this test is satisfied the second test \\nwhich still remains to be applied is that the approver\\'s \\nevidence must receive sufficient corroboration. This \\ntest is special to the cases of weak or tainted evidence \\nlike that of the approver.\" These observations were \\nmade in the special circumstances of the case which \\nthis Court was deciding when dealing with the case of \\nSarwan Singh. This Court went on to observe, \" The \\nargument that the character of the approver\\'s evid\\xad\\nence has not been considered by the High Court \\ncannot be characterised as merely academic or theo\\xad\\nretical in the present case because, as we shall presently \\npoint out, the evidence of the approver is so thoroughly \\ndiscrepant that it would be difficult to resist the \\nconclusion that the approver in the present case is a \\nwholly unreliable witness. Indeed it may be legitimate \\nto point out that the learned Judges of the High Court \\nhave themselves criticised the evidence of the approver \\nin dealing with the prosecution case against Gurdial \\nSingh and have ultimately found that the account \\ngiven by the approver is unreliable and, though there \\nwas circumstantial evidence which raised an amount \\nof suspicion against Gurdial Singh, that would not be \\nenough to sustain his conviction. It seems to us that \\nif it was found that the approver\\'s account against \\none of the accused persons was wholly discrepant, this \\n(I) (1916) • K.B.D. 658. -S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 131 \\nfinding itself should inevitably have led the court to \\nscrutinise his evidence in respect of the other accused \\npersons with greater caution.\" It is clear therefore \\nthat in the special circumstances of the case of Sarwan \\nSingh the approver had been found to be a wholly \\nunreliable witness. It is important to observe that this \\nCourt stated that the approver\\'s evidence must show \\nthat he is a reliable witness and that is the test which \\nis common to all witnesses. Nothing has been shown \\nto us in this case, as was shown in Sarwan Singh\\'s \\ncase that apart from the approver\\'s testimony in the \\npresent case being regarded as tainted evidence his \\nevidence as it stood was in any way unreliable. \\nIndeed, the Sessions Judge went to the length of \\ntelling the jury that although an approver\\'s evidence \\nis strictly admissible and a conviction is not illegal \\nmerely because it is based on an approver\\'s evidence, \\nit was a settled rule of practice not to convict a person \\non such evidence except under very rare and excep\\xad\\ntional circumstances and usually substantial cor\\xad\\nroboratLm was required. The jury could not have been \\nmore clearly warned about the danger of acting on an \\napprover\\'s evidence. In other words, the jury were \\ntold not to convict the appellant on the approver\\'s \\nevidence unless his evidence had been substantially \\ncorroborated. Apart from the question of corrobora\\xad\\ntion of the approver\\'s evidence nothing was suggested \\nto us or to the High Court in what respect the \\napprover\\'s evidence was unreliable after testing his \\nevidence in the same way as one would test the evid\\xad\\nence of any witness for the prosecution in a criminal \\ncase. In our opinion, the decision in Sarwan Singh\\'s \\ncase can be distinguished in the present case. \\nObviously, it was never suggested that the approver\\'s \\nevid~nce in this case was entirely unreliable, if his \\nevidence was tested in the same way as the evidence \\nof any prosecution witness in a criminal trial. We \\ncannot accept the submission made on behalf of the \\nappellant that the charge to the jury is vitiated \\nbecause of the decision of this Court in Sarwa.n Singh\\'s \\ncase.

I959 \\' \\nJ nanendra Nath \\nGhose \\nv. \\nThe Slate of \\nWest Ben.gal \\nImam]. 132 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] \\nAs to the second submission made by Mr. Umrigar \\nit is to be remembered that in Baskerville\\'s case the \\nCourt of Criminal Appeal in England after discussing \\nvarious authorities on the subject came to the follow\\xad\\ning conclusion :-\\n\" We hold that evidence in corroboration must be \\nindependent testimony which affects the accused by \\nconnecting or tending to connect him with the crime. \\nIn other words, it must be evidence which implicates \\nhim, that is, which confirms in some n;iaterial parti\\xad\\ncular not only the evidence that the crime has been \\ncommitted, but also that the prisoner committed it. \\nThe test applicable to determine the nature and \\nextent. of the corroboration is thus the same whether \\nthe case falls within the rule of practice at common \\nlaw or within that class of offences for which corro\\xad\\nboration is required by statute. The language of the \\nstatute, implicates the accused, \" compendiously in\\xad\\ncorporates the test applicable at common law in the \\nrule of practice. The nature of the corroboration \\nwill necessarily vary according to the particular \\ncircumstances of the offence charged. It would be \\nin high degree dangerous to attempt to formulate \\nthe kind of evidence which would be regarded as \\ncorroboration, except to say that corroborative \\nevidence is evidence which shows or tends to show \\nthat the story of the accomplice that the accused \\ncommitted the crime is true, not merely that the \\ncrime has been committed, but that it was commit\\xad\\nted by the accused. \\n\" The corroboration need not be direct evidence \\nthat the accused committed the crime; it is suffici\\xad\\nent if it is merely circumstantial evidence of his \\nconnection with the crime. \" \\nIn the present case the jury had been clearly directed \\nby the Sessions Judge that corroborative evidence \\nmust be evidence which implicates the accused, i.e., \\nwhich confirms in some material particulars not only \\nthe evidence that the crime had been committed but \\nalso that the appellant had committed it. The \\nSessions Judge told the jury that \"Corroborative -s.c.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 133 \\nevidence, you should bear in mind, is evidence which \\nshows or tends to show t\"hat the story of the accomplice \\nthat the accused committed the crime is true. The \\ncorroboration need not be direct evidence that the \\naccused committed the crime. It is sufficient if it is \\nmerely circumstantial evidence of his connection with \\nthe crime. The\\' corroboration in material particulars \\nmust be such a.s to connect or identify each of the \\naccused with the offence. \" It seems to us that the \\nSessions Judge directed the jury in accordance with \\nthe principle laid down in Baskerville\\'s case and no \\nserious objection can be taken to the manner in which \\nthe Sessions Judge directed, the jury in this respect. \\nThe moment there is corroborative evidence which \\nconnects or tends to connect an accused with the crime \\nsuch corroborative evidence relates to the identity of \\nthe accused· in connection with that crime. It is the \\napprover\\'s evidence which is the direct evidence of the \\ncrime. There should be corroboration in material \\nparticulars not only concerning the crime but corrobor\\xad\\nation of the approver\\'s story by evidence whi9h \\nconnects or tends to connect an accused with the \\ncrime. It is this corroborative evidence which deter\\xad\\nmines the _mind of the Court or a jury that the \\napprover\\'s evidence that the accused committed the \\ncrime is true. \\nAs to the 3rd submission made on behalf of the \\nappellant the following circumstances were established \\nby the evidence which were accepted by the jury : \\nL There was a motive for the appellant to \\ncommit the crime, that is to say, his immoral \\nproposal to Lila, wife of the deceased. \\n2. On the 25th of May, 1955, the appellant came \\nto Lila\\'s house and had a talk with the deceased. \\n3. On the 26th of May, 1955, in the morning the \\nappellant also came to the house and talked with \\nthe deceased. Later on that very day a little after \\nsunset the appellant came to the house and asked \\nthe deceased to go for a walk with him. The \\ndeceased did so. \\' \\n4.

According to the approver. at the time that \\nthe deceased was stabbed by the appellant he had \\nsustained an injury on the dorsum of his left palm. \\nThe medical evidence established that the appellant \\nhad an almost healed up ulcer t inch in length on the \\nleft side of the palm at its posterior surface one inch \\nbelowthewrist joint and another healed up ulcer iinch \\nin length on the left thumb at the posterior surface \\nand that these injuries could be caused by a sharp \\ncutting weapon like a knife. \\n6. As it had become night and the deceased had \\nnot returned, Lila\\'s mother Brojeswari and her \\nuncle Radharaman Sadhu searched for him. They \\nwent to the club-house where the appellant and his \\ntwo co-accused Jagdish Gorain and Sudhir Gorain \\nand the approver used to associate with each other. \\nWhen enquiries were made from the appellant by \\nBrojeswari he first replied that the deceased had \\nnot gone with him and that he did not know \\nanything about his whereabouts. When he was \\nremainded that it was he who had taken the deceased \\nfor a walk which he was denying, the appellant \\nreplied that the deceased went with him upto the \\ncanal towards north of the village, but as he felt a. \\nheadache he came away and it was not possible for \\nthe appellant to give any news about the deceased\\'s \\nwhereabouts. \\nThe above-mentioned circumstances either indi\\xad\\nvidually or collectively may fall short of proving that \\nthe appellant committed the murder of the deceased. \\nIndeed, the High Court was of the opinion that these \\ncircumstances independent of the direct evidence of \\nthe approver would not be sufficient to induce any \\nreasonable person to come to the conclusion that the \\nappellant had committed the crime. As already \\nstated, however, the approver\\'s evidence is the direct \\n· evidence which establishes that the appellant had \\nmurdered the deceased. The jury had to decide for \\nthemselves whether the above-mentioned circum\\xad\\nstances were sufficient corroborative evidence to satisfy S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 135 \\nthem that the approver\\'s evidence that the appellant \\nmurdered the deceased was true. It is, however, urged \\nby Mr. Umrigar that the circumstances mentioned \\nwere not circumstances corroborating the evidence of \\nthe approver in material particulars which would \\nconnect or tend to connect the appellant with the \\ncrime. In our opinion, at least in one circumstance \\nthe corroboration is in a very material particular \\nconnecting or tending to connect the appellant with \\nthe crime. The approver\\'s evidence that while the \\nappellant was murdering the deceased he had received \\nan injury on the dorsum of his left palm is corrobora.t. \\ned by the m_edical evidence. It was, however, pointed \\nout that the medical evidence does not show that the \\ninjury was on the dorsum of the left palm. In our \\nopinion, there is no substance in this submission \\nbecause the first injury is described as one on the left \\nside of the palm at its posterior surface I inch below the \\nwrist joint, that is to say, the dorsum of the left pa.Im. \\nThe second injury is clearly on the left thumb at its \\nposteri9r surface which is also consistent with the \\nevidence of the approver that the dorsum of the left \\npa.Im was injured. The jury were entitled to accept \\nthis evidence as sufficient corroboration in a. material \\nparticular connecting the appellant or. tending to \\nconnect him with the crime. In addition, the cir· \\ncumsta.nce that it was the appellant who had called \\nfor the deceased a little after sunset and ha.d·ta.ken \\nhim a.way and thereafter was seen going a.long towards \\nthe north of the village with the deceased and that \\nthereafter the deceased was not seen a.live was one \\nupon which the jury could rely in coming to the \\nconclusion that it connected or tended to connect the \\nappellant with the crime. The appellant\\'s pretended \\nignorance of the whereabouts of the deceased that \\nvery night and his ultimate admission that he had \\nta.ken the deceased towards the north of the village \\nwas also a circumstance upon which the jury could \\nrely as inconsistent with his innocence. In our \\nopinion, all the circumstances referred to above were \\nsufficient corroboration of the approver\\'s evidence \\nconnecting or tending to connect the appellant with · I959 \\n] nantndra N allt \\nGhose \\nv. \\nThe State of \\nWest Bengal \\nImam]. 1959 \\nJnanmdra Nath \\nGhose \\nv. \\nThe State of \\nWest Bengal \\nImam]. 136 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960{1}] \\nthe crime and accordingly the approver\\'s evidence \\nthat the appellant did commit the crime was true. \\nAs to the 4th submission that although there was \\nsimilar corroboration of the approver\\'s evidence \\nagainst J agdish Gorain but he had been acquitted by \\nthe jury although no real distinction between his case \\nand the case of the appellant arose is unsound as, in \\nour opinion, the two cases are not comparable. In \\nthe first place, there \"7as no motive for J agdish Gorain \\nto commit the murder. In the second place, the injury \\nwhich Jagdish received was while he caught the knife \\nin the hand of the appellant saying \"what have you \\ndone?\" The approver\\'s evidence therefore rather tended \\nto show that he tried to prevent the appellant from \\nfurther stabbing the deceased. These circumstances \\nmay have induced the jury to make a distinction \\nbetween the case of Jagdish Gorain and the appel\\xad\\nlant. It was for the jury to say whether they regarded \\nthe circumstantial evidence as sufficient to connect or \\ntending to connect Jagdish with the crime. It would \\nseem that on the approver\\'s evidence the jury may \\nwell have regarded the circumstances as insufficient \\ncorroboration to connect or tending to connect J agdish \\nGorain with the crime. \\nIn our opinion, it. cannot be said with anygood \\nreason that there was any defect in the charge to the \\njury delivered by the Sessions ;Judge which would \\njustify us in saying that the verdict of the jury was \\nvitiated.

The case of the respondents was \\nthat they were workers within the meaning of s. 2(1) of the \\nFactories Act, 1948 (LXIII of 1948) and as such were entitled \\nto overtime wages under s. 59 of the said Act. Alternatively, \\nthey urged that even if they. were not workers within the mean. \\ning of s. 2(1) of the said Act, they would nevertheless be entitled \\nto overtime wages under the s. 59 by reason of s. 70 of .the \\nBombay Shops and Establishments Act, 1948 (Born. 79 of 1948). \\nThe validity of the claim on both the grounds was disputed by \\nthe appellant. The Authority under the Payment of Wages Act \\nfound that only four of the respondents, who were required to do \\nthe work of progress timekeepers, could claim the status of \\nworkers within the meaning of s. 2(1) of the Factories Act and \\nthe rest were merely employees of the workshop, but the \\nAuthority accepted the alternative case made by the respond\\xad\\nents and directed the appellant to file a statement showing the \\novertime wages due to each of the respondents and ordered it to \\npay the same. \\nHeld, that the Authority was right in the view that fr took \\nof s. 70 of the Bombay Shops and Establishments Act, 1948, and \\nits decision must be affirmed. \\nOn a proper construction of s. 70 of the Act it is clear that \\nthe first part of the section excludes a factory and its employees \\nfrom the operation of the Act ; but the second part makes the \\nrelevant provisions of the Factories Act applicable to them.

All these \\napplications were heard by the Payment of Wages \\nAuthority, Bombay, as companion matters and they \\nhave been disposed of by a common judgment. The \\nmain judgment has, however, been delivered by the \\nsaid Authority in the application filed by Mr. C.

We \\nwould, therefore, deal with this appeal in particular \\nand our decision in this appeal will govern the rest of \\nthe appeals in this group. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 139 \\nIn his application made before the Payment of I959 \\nW a.ges Authority the respondent alleged that h~ had \\nbeen employed in the factory called the Central Rail- B. P~.Hir• \\nway Workshop and Factory, Pa.rel, Bombay, and tha.t c. M. Prlld\"\\'1,. \\nhe had not been paid overtime wages due to him from \\nApril 1, 1949, to September 30, 1954. The respondent Gajn4ra11SdkM J. \\nclaimed that the delay made by him in filing the \\npresent application should be condoned because jointly \\nwith his co-workers he had been in correspondence \\nwith the railway administration in regard to the sa.id \\npayment of overtime wages since 1948 and that the \\nclaim ma.de by him and his colleagues had been finally \\nrejected by the railway administration on August 31, \\n1954. His case was that he had filed the present applic-\\nation soon thereafter and so the delay made by him \\nin making the claim before the Authority , should be \\ncondoned. The Authority heard the parties on the \\nquestion of delay and held that the delay only in re,s-\\npect of the claim for the period after May 1953 should \\nbe condoned. · In the result the claim for overtime \\nwages for the period prior to May 19, 1953, was rejected \\non the preliminary ground of delay whereas the claim \\nfor the period subsequent to the sa.id da.te wa.s con-\\nsidered on the merits.• \\nThe respondent\\'s ca.se wa.s that he was entitled to \\nthe overtime wages for work on such Sundays when \\nhe was not given a holiday within three da.ys prior to \\nor three da.ys subsequent to the Sundays on which he \\nworked. The appellant conceded that the respondent \\nhad not been given a. holiday within the three days \\nprior to or the three da.ys subsequent to the Sundays \\non which he had worked as required by s. 52 of the \\nIndian Factories Act. The respondent alleged tha.t he \\nwa.s a. worker within the meaning of s. 2, sub-s. (1) of \\nthe said Factories Act (LXIII of 1948) and &f! such he \\nwa.s entitled to overtime wages under s 59 of the said \\nAct. Alternatively he urged that even if he wa.s not a \\nworker within the meaning of s. 2(1) of the sa.id Act, \\nhe would neverthless be entitled to overtime wages \\nunder the said s. 59 by reason of s. 70 of the Bombay \\nShops and Establishments Act, 1948 (Bom. 79 of 1948) \\n(hereafter called the Act). Thus the claim for. 140 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1960(1)] \\nz959 overtime wages was made by the respondent on two \\nalternative grounds. \\nB. P~.Hir• The appellant disputed the validity of this claim. \\nc. M. Prod/Jan It was urged on its behalf that the respondent was not \\na worker under s. 2(1) of the ]\\'actories Act and that \\nGojm4ro1•dk•r J. s. 70 of the Act did not justfy the claim alternatively \\nmade by the respondent for overtime wages. \\nThe Authority considered the evidence led before it \\nin respect of all the repondents for overtime wages. It \\nappears that these respondents are employed by the \\nappellant in the time office of the Pare! Workshop and \\nnot in the factory itself. The duties of these time\\xad\\nkeepers are to maintain initial records of attendance \\nof workshop staff, to prepare pay-sheets for them to \\nmaintain their leave accounts, to dispose of final settle\\xad\\nment cases of the said staff and to maintain records \\nfor satistical information. The Authority held that \\nthe time office where the timekeepers work is an integ\\xad\\nral part of the factory and so it came to the conclusion \\nthat the timekeepers are employed in the factory called \\nthe Central Railway Workshop and Factory, Parel, \\nBombay. \\nThe Authority then examined. the question as to \\nwhether the timekeepers are workers within the mean\\xad\\ning of s. 2(1) of the Factories Act. Evidence showed \\nthat four timekeepers, are required to do the work of \\nprogress timekeepers. This work consists in preparing \\nthe progress time-sheets and operation time-sheets of \\nmachine-shop staff working on various jobs dealing with \\nthe production of railway spare parts. The Allthority \\nwas disposed to take the view that having regard to \\nthe nature of the work assigned to the progress time\\xad\\nkeepers they must be held to be persons employed in \\nwork incidental to, or connected with the manufac\\xad\\nturing process or the subject of the manufacturing \\nprocess and as such they are workers within the mean\\xad\\ning of s. 2(1) of the Factories Act. In the result, the \\nfinding made by the Authority was that timekeepers \\nare employees of the workshop, but are not workers \\nunder the Factories Act ; while the progress time\\xad\\nkeepers can claim the status of workers under the \\nsaid Act. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 141 \\nThe Authority then considered the respondent\\'s z959 \\nargument that even if he was not a worker under the B . • P. H.,a Factories Act he was neverthless entitled to claim v. \\nthe benefit of s. 59 of the said Act by virtue of s. 70 c. M. Pradharl \\nof the Act. The Authority accepted this contention . -\\nand held that, even if the respondent was not a. Ga1enaragadkar J. \\nworker under the Factories Act, s. 70 of the Act \\nentitled him to claim overtime wages under s. 59 \\nof the Factories Act. That is why the Authority \\norslered that the respondents would be entitled \\nfdr the period 19-5-1953 to 30-9-1954 to overtime \\nwages at double the ordinary rate for the Sundays \\non which they worked when they were not given a \\na holiday on one of the three days immediately \\npreceding or after the said Sunday. The appellant \\nwas accordingly directed to file a statement showing \\nthe overtime wages to which the several respondents \\nwere entitled and orders were passed on each one of \\nthe applications directing the appellant to pay the \\nrespective amounts to each one of the respondents. \\nIt is against these orders that the appellant has filed \\nthe present group of appeals by special leave. \\nThe first point which has been urged before us by \\nthe learned Attorney-General on behalf of the appel\\xad\\nlant is that the Authority was in error in holding that \\nthe progress timekeepers are workers under s. 2(1) of \\nthe Factories Act. A worker under s. 2(1) means a \\nperson employed directly or through any agency, \\nwhether for wages or not, in any manufacturing pro\\xad\\ncess, or in cleaning any part of the machinery or \\npremises used for manufacturing process, or in any \\nother kind of work incidental to, or connected with, \\nthe manufacturing process, or the subject of the \\nmanufacturing process; and the manufacturing pro\\xad\\ncess under s. 2(k) means any process for inter alia (1) \\nmaking, altering, repairing, ornamenting, finishing, \\npacking, oiling, washing, cleaning, breaking-up, \\ndemolishing or otherwise treating or adapting any \\narticle or substance with a view to its use, sale, \\ntransport, delivery or disposal. It is clear that the \\nduties of the progress timekeepers do not fall within \\nthe first pa.rt of s. 2(k). The Authority has however, 142 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] \\nz959 held that the said duties can be treated as incidental \\nto, or connected with, the manufacturing process or \\nB. P~.Hira the subject of manufacturing process; it is the \\nc. M. Pradhan correctness of this finding that is challenged by the \\nappellant. \\nGaj\"\"1raga4har J. On the other hand, Mr. Purshottam, for the res\\xad\\npondents, argues that the Authority was in error \\nin holding that the timekeepers are not workers under \\ns. 2 (1). His contention is that the expression \\n\"incidental to, or connected with, the manufacturing \\nprocess\" is wide enough to include not only the cases \\nof the progress timekeepers but the cases of all time\\xad\\nkeepers as a class. It is true that the finding of the \\nAuthority in respect of the timekeepers is against the \\nrespondents; but Mr. Purshottam says that he is \\nentitled to support the final order passed by the \\nAuthority on the additional ground that the time\\xad\\nkeepers, like the progress timekeepers, are workers \\nunder s. 2(1) and as such they are entitled to claim \\novertime wages under s. 59 of the Factories Act. \\nThe final decision of the Authority is, however, \\nbased on the view that under s. 70 of the Act the \\nrespondents would be entitled to overtime wages \\nunder s. 59 of the Factories Act even if they are not \\nworkers under s. 2(1). That being so, we think it is \\nnecessary first to consider the correctness of this view. \\nIf the conclusion of the Authority on the scop_e and \\neffect of the provisions of s. 70 of the Act is correct, \\nthen it would be unnecessary to consider whether the \\ntimekeepers and the progress timekeepers are workers \\nunder s. 2(1) of the Factories Act. We would, there\\xad\\nfore, deal with that question first. \\nIt appears that there are three statutes which pro\\xad\\nvide for the payment of extra. wages for overtime \\nwork. The proviso to s. 71 (c) of the Indian Railways \\nAct (IX of 1890) lays down that the exempted railway \\nservant specified in it shall be pa.id for overtime at \\nnot less than one and a quarter times his ordinary \\nrate of pay. This provision has been subsequently \\namended by Act 59of1956, which makes the rate for \\novertime one and one-half times the ordinary rate \\nof pay ; but it is common ground that we are not S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 143 \\nconcerned with the a.mended provision in these appeals z959 \\nsince the respondents\\' claim is for a period prior to \\nI . d b h B. P. Hir11 the date of the amendment. t is suggeste y t e v. \\nappellant that the respondents are railway servants c. M. Pradhlln \\nunder s. 3 (7) of the said Act, and as such they may --\\nbe entitled to make a. claim for overtime wages under Gajendragadkar J. \\nthe said proviso ; but the respondents have not made, \\nand do not wish to make, a claim under the said \\nprovision; and so the question as to the application \\nof the said section need not detain us. If the con-\\nstruction placed on s. 70 of the Act by the Authority \\nis cor.rect, the claims of employees who are working in \\na. factory in the State of Bombay would be governed \\nby that provision; this position is not seriously dis-\\nputed before us. \\nSection 59 of the Factories Act also deals with the \\nquestion of extra. wages for overtime. It provides \\nfor the payment of wages in respect of overtime work \\nat the rate of twice the ordinary rate of wages. This \\nbenefit is, however, available only to persons who a.re \\nworkers within the meaning of s. 2(1) of the said Act \\nSince we are dealing with the ca.se on the assumption \\nthat the respondents are not workers under s. 2(1) it \\nfollows that s. 59 by itself would not be applicable \\nto them. \\nThe Bombay Shops and Establishments Act, 1948, \\nis the third statute which makes a. provision for the \\npayment of extra wages for overtime work. Section \\n63 of the Act deals with this topic ... Section 63(1) \\nprovides for the payment of overtime work at the \\nrate of H times the ordinary rate of w~ges in the \\ncase of employees in any establishment other than a \\nresidential hotel, restaurant, or eating-house, whereas \\nsub-s. (2) provides for wages for overtime at the rate \\nof twice the ordinary rate of wages in respect of \\nemployees in a residential hotel, restaurant or eating\\xad\\nhouse, subject to the other conditions specified in the \\nsaid section. It is clear that this section does not \\napply to the respondents because they are employees \\nin a. factory and not in any of the establishments \\nenumerated in its two sub-sections. 144 SUPREM~ COURT REPORTS (1960(1)] \\nz959 The respondents\\' case, however, is that by virtue of \\ns. 70 of the Act the provisions of the Factories Act, \\nB. P~.HiY• including s. 59, are extended to the cases of all em-\\nc. M. Pradhan ployees in factories, and so they are entitled to claim \\n- wages for overtime under the said section of the \\nGajendragadkar J. Factories Act. This contention has been upheld by \\nthe Authority. It is not disputed by the appellant \\nthat the Bombay Legislature was competent to \\nprescribe for the extension of the provisions of the \\nFactories Act to employees in the factories within the \\nterritory of the State of Bombay; and since sanction \\nfor this legislation has been duly obtained from the \\nGovernor-General of India on January 3, 1949(\\'), no \\nquestion about ll.ny repugnance between the provi\\xad\\nsions of s. 70 and those of the Factories Act can pos\\xad\\nsibly a.rise. Thus the validity of the said section is not \\nin dispute; and so the only point which calls for our \\ndecision is one of construction: Does s. 70 supplement \\nthe provisions of the Factories Act by extending them \\nto all employees in factories like the respondents \\nthough they are not workers under s. 2(1) of the \\nsaid Act? \\nBefore dealing with this point it is necessary to \\nrefer briefly to the broad features of the Act. The \\nAct no doubt is a piece of beneficent social legislation \\nintended to serve the cause of labour welfare. It has \\nbeen passed in order to consolidate and amend the \\nlaw relating to the regulat.ion and conditions of work \\nand employment in shops, commercial establishments, \\nresidential hotels, restaurants, eating-houses, theatres, \\nother places of public amusements and entertainments \\nand other establishments. Section 2, sub-ss. (3), (4) \\nand {27) define respectivly the establishment, commer\\xad\\ncial establishment and shop. The definitions of com\\xad\\nmercial establishment and shop exclude inter alia \\nfactory. Establishment is defind as meaning a shop, \\ncommercial establishment, residential hotel, restaurant, \\neating-house, theatre or other place of public amuse\\xad\\nment are entertainment to which the Act applies and \\nincludes such other establishment as the State Govern\\xad\\nment may by notification in the official gazette declare \\n(I) Published in the Bombay Government Gazette, Part IV. \\ndated 11·1·1949. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REJ:>OH.TS 145 \\nto be an establishment for the purposes of this Act. \\nIt would be noticed that the definition of establishment I959 \\nB. \\'P. Hira is very wide, and it does not purport to be exhaustive v. \\nbecause it expressly empowers the State Government c. M. Pradhan \\nto include within its purview by notification other . . -\\nestablishments not specified in it. Section 2, sub-s. (6) Ga1endragadliar J. \\ndefines an employee as meaning a person wholly or \\nprincipally employed in, and in connection with, any \\nestablishment, and includes an apprentice hut does \\nnot include a member of the employer\\'s family. \\'.fhis \\ndefinition shows that the Act intends to confer the \\nbenefit of its provision on all persons who fall within \\nthe wide definition of the expression\" Employee\". \\nIt is necessary at this stage to refer to the definition \\nof \" factory \" under the Act. Section 2(9) defines a \\nfactory as meaning any premises which is a factory \\nwithin the meaning of cl. (m) of s. 2 of the ]\\'actories \\n.A,ct or which is deemed to be a factory under s. 85 of \\nthe said Act. \\nNows. 2(m) of the Factories Act defines a factory as \\nmeaning any premises including the precincts thereof-\\n\" (i) whereon ten or more workers are working, \\nor were working on any day of the preceding \\ntwelve months, and in any part of which a \\nmanufacturing process is being carried on with the \\naid of power, or is ordinarily so carried on, or \\n(ii) whereon twenty or more workers are working, \\nor were working on aiiy day of the preceding twelve \\nmonths, and in any part of which a manufacturing \\nprocess is being carried on without the aid of power, \\nor is ordinarily so carried on,-\\nbut does not include a mine subject to the opera\\xad\\ntion of the Mines Act, 1952 (XXXV of 1952), or a \\nrailway running shed;\" \\nands. 85 confers authori\\'.y on the State Government \\nto extend the definition of factory to other places \\nsubject to the requirements specified in the said section. \\nIt is common ground that the place where the respon\\xad\\ndents are employed is a factory under s. 2(m) of the \\n}i\\'actories Act, and so it satisfies the defiuition of s. 2(9) \\nof the Act. \\n19 146 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] \\nz95o The scheme of the Act shows that it deals separately \\nwith shops and commercial establishments (ch. III), \\nn. P~.Hfra residential hotels, restaurants and eating-houses (ch. \\nc. M. Pradhan IV) and theatres and other places of public amusement \\n(ch. V). Separate provisions are made to regulate \\nGajendragadkar J. these different establishments having regard to the \\nspecial needs of each one of them. There are, however, \\ngeneral provisions applicable to and regulating all the \\nestablishments alike and these are found in chs. VI to \\nIX. It is significant that with the exception of s. 70, \\nno other section of the Act deals with factories. \\nWe have already noticed that in defining \"com\\xad\\nmercial establishment\" and \"shop \" respectively the \\nAct has expressly excluded \" factories \" from the said \\nexpressions. It is true that the definition of \"establish\\xad\\nment\" does not expressly exclude factory ; but it is \\nplain that factory is treated by the Act as separate and \\ndistinct and there can be no doubt that the provisions \\nin the Act which apply to establishment are not \\nintended to, and do not, apply to factories. In other \\nwords, though the definition of \" establishmept\" is \\nwide enough, it does not include factory for the pur\\xad\\nposes of the Act. It is conceivable that a kitchen \\nattached to an establishment like a residential hotel \\nmay satisfy the definition of factory ; but it seems to \\nus that such an adjunct of an establishment is prima \\nfacie not intended by the Act to be treated apart and \\nseparately from the main establishment itself; and so \\nit would be taken as a part of the establishment and \\nbe governed by the provisions of the Act in relation \\nthereto. The factory where the respondents are \\nemployed is not connected with, much less an insepar\\xad\\nable adjunct of, any establishment, and so this aca\\xad\\ndemic aspect of the matter which was incidentally posed \\nbefore us by the learned Attorney-General need not be \\npursued any further in the present appeal. \\nThe conclusion of the Authority has been challenged \\nby the appellant on the ground that s. 70 on which it \\nis based cannot be invoked by the respondents. In \\nsupport of this argument reliance is placed on s. 4 of \\nthe Act. Section 4 provides that notwithstanding \\nanything contained in the Act its provisions mentioned S.C.R. SUPREME COUR\\'l\\' REPORTS 147 \\nin the third column of sch. II shall not apply to z959 \\nthe establishments, employees and other persons men-\\nh d 1 f h \\'d B. P. Hira tioncd against them in t e secon co mun o t e sai v. \\nschedule. The proviso to this section authorises the c. M. Pradhan \\nState Government to add to, omit or alter any of the \\nentries in the said schedule in the manner indicated Gajentlragatlkar J. \\nby it. It is urged that the establishment of any rail-\\nway administration is mentioned as sr. no. 5 in sch. \\nII and the entry against it in col. 3 of the said schedule \\nshows that the provisions of the Act are inapplicable \\nto the said establishments. If the establishment in \\nquestion is exempted from the application of all the \\nprovisions of the Act, how can s. 70 be said to apply \\nto it? asks the learned Attorney-General. lt is obvious \\nthats. 4 mentions and applies only to establishments \\nand it has no application to factories ; and we are \\ndealing with employees in a factory. Indeed as we \\nhave already observed, no provision of the Act except \\ns. 70 applies to factories and so it would not be legiti-\\nmate to base any argument on the assumption that \\ns. 4 is applioable to the present case. \\nIncidentally the learned Attorney-General suggested, \\nthough faintly, that the establishments mentioned at \\nsr. nos. 1 to 6 in col. 2 of sch. II are wider than and \\ndifferent from the establishment as defined by s. 2(8). \\nWe do not think that this suggestion is well-founded. \\nThere can be no doubt thats. 4 grants exemptions to \\nthe said establishments from the application of the \\nprovisions mentioned in col. 3 of sch. II ; and that \\nitself postulates that but for the exemption thus \\ngranted the provisions of the Act would have applied \\nto them. Indeed the scheme of sch. II shows that \\nwhereas all the provisions of the Act are made inapplic\\xad\\nable to the establishments and offices enumerated at \\nsr. nos. 1 to 6 including 6(a) to 6(k), in regard to the \\nothers which are enumerated at sr. nos. 7 to 55 it is \\nonly some provisions of the Act specified in col. 3 that \\nare excluded. In other words, the remaining sections \\nnot so specified would apply to them. If that is so, \\nthey must be and are establishments under s. 2(8) of \\nthe Act. 148 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] \\n1959 In this connection it must be borne in mind that \\ns. 2(8) empowers the State Government to include by \\nB. P ~.Hira notification any office or institution within the defini\\xad\\nc. M. Pradhan tion of establishment; and so the inclusion of any such \\noffice or institution in col. 2 of sch. II would make it \\nGajcndragadkar J. an establishment under the Act, and as such it would \\nbe governed by it subject of course to the correspond\\xad\\ning entry in col. 3. That is why we think that the \\nsuggestion of the leafrned Attorney-General as to the \\ndenotation and character of establishments enumerat\\xad\\ned in sr. nos. 1 to 5 in col. 2 of sch. II cannot be \\naccepted. All the offices, establishments and other \\ninstitutions mentioned in col. 2 of sch. II are and must \\nbe held to be establishments under s. 2(8). \\nIn regard to the argument that the. operation of \\ns. 4 excludes the application of s. 70 we have held that \\ns. 4 applies only to establishments and not to factories. \\nBut even ifs. 4 is assumed to be applicable to factories, \\nwe do not think it would materially affect the applica\\xad\\ntion of s. 70. The plain object underlying s. 70 and \\nits context emphatically point out that it is intended \\nto operate independently of the other provisions of the \\nAct and in that sense it stands apart from them. It is \\nthis aspect of the matter which is clarified by the \\nLegislature by laying down in s. 70 that nothing in the \\nAct shall be deemed to apply to any persons employed \\nin the factory. That, however, anticipates the argu\\xad\\nment on the construction of s. 70. Let us therefore, \\ncite the said section and construe it. \\nSection 70 provides that nothing in this Act shall be \\ndeemed to apply to any person employed in or within \\nthe precincts of a factory and the provisions of the \\nFactories Act shall, notwithstanding anything in the \\nsaid Act, apply to such person. This section consists \\nof two .parts. The first part makes it clear that no \\nprovision in the Act shall be deemed to apply to the \\npersons specified in it. The Legislature knew that in \\nfact the Act contained no provision which in terms or \\nexpressly applies to any such person; but in order to \\nremove any possible doubt it has provided that no \\nprovision in the Act shall even by inference or fiction \\nbe deemed to apply to them. In other words this clause .. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 149 \\nI959 is intended to clarify the position that though factory \\nhas been defined by s. 2(9) of the Act, no provision of \\nA d B.P.Hira the ct is inten ed to be applied to a. factory or v. \\nemployees in it. Having clarified this position the c. M. Pradhan\\' \\nsecond part of the section extends the application of . --\\nthe Factories Act to the said persons. Ga1endragadkar J. \\nIt would have been possible for the Legislature to \\ninclude in the present statute a.11 the relevant provisions \\nof the Factories Act and make them applicable to \\nfactories as defined by s. 2(9); but apparently the \\nLegislature thought that the same object can be \\nachieved by enacting the second part of s. 70. This \\npart provides that the provisions of the Factories Act \\nshall a.pply to the persons in question notwithstanding \\nanything contained in the said Act. The said Act \\ncontalns the provision by which workers are defined \\nunder s. 2(1), and it necessarily involves the conse\\xad\\nquerue that the relevant provision about the payment \\nof o>ertime wages applies only to workers as defined \\nand not to employees in factories who are not workers. \\nIt is in reference to this provision that s. 70 has provi\\xad\\nded t.liat notwithstanding the said provision the relevant \\nprovsions of the Factories Act will apply to persons \\nemployed in a factory. The non-obstante clause in \\ns. 7( thus serves the purpose of clarifying the position \\nthatthe Factories Act is made applicable to employees \\nin factories and that they are not governed by any of \\nthe Jrovisions of the Act. This conclusion is. obviously \\ncomi.stent with the policy of the Act. It has itself \\nmacb provision for the payment of overtime wages to \\nempoyees in all establishments by s. 63 ; and it has \\nmade applicable inter alia the relevant provisions of \\nthe 1actories Act in regard to employees in factories. \\nTha1 is the view which the Authority has taken, and \\nin 01r opinion its validity or correctness is not open to \\ndoult. \\nInthe result the orders passed by the authority are \\nconfiomed and the appeals are dismissed with costs in \\none set. \\nAppeals dismissed.

LTD. A ND SHRI HARISH BIYANI   \\nIN THE MATTER OF IRREGULAR TRANSACTIONS IN THE SCRIP OF DSQ \\nINDUSTRIES LTD  \\n           \\n1.0  BACKGROUND  \\n \\n1.1 Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani are former members of \\nCalcutta Stock Exchange (“CSE”).  \\n \\n1.2 DSQ Industries Ltd. was  formerly known as Lexus Exports Ltd. DSQ \\nIndustries now known as Jardine Overseas Ltd. is a group company  of \\nShri Dinesh Dalmia - main promoter of DSQ Software. Its shares are listed \\non the Calcutta Stock Exchange. DSQ Industries has its registered office \\naddress at 11/1A, Chowringhee Terrace, Calcutta – 700 020 and \\ncorporate office address is at 407 -408, G.R. Complex, Anna Salai \\nNandanam, Chennai – 600 035.  \\n \\n1.3 SEBI conducted investigation into the trading in the shares of DSQ \\nIndustries Ltd. and the followi ng was observed:  \\n \\nThe total paid -up share capital of DSQ Industries Ltd. was Rs. \\n20,04,29,160 consisting of 2,00,42,916 shares of Rs. 10/ - each.  \\n \\nAs per the distribution schedule furnished by the company to SEBI, its \\nbroad shareholding pattern as on 28/09 /2001 was as under:  \\n Page 2 of 41  \\nParticulars  No. of Shares  % of  total no. of shares  \\nForeign Holdings  \\n - Non Resident Companies   \\n6,68,516   \\n3.33%  \\nGovt / Govt Sponsored FI’s  \\n - Mutual Funds   \\n2,76,000   \\n1.37%  \\nDirectors and Relatives  1,18,800  0.59%  \\nPromoter Companies   2,22,300  1.11%  \\nOther bodies corporate  1,06,36,700  53.07%  \\nOthers  8120600  40.51%  \\nTotal  2,00,42,916  100.00%  \\n \\nIt was also observed that as per the previous distribution schedule dated \\n28/09/2000, its shareholding pattern was as under:  \\n \\nParticulars  No. o f Shares  % of  total no. of shares  \\nForeign Holdings  \\n - Non Resident Companies   \\n95,96,216   \\n47.878%  \\nGovt / Govt Sponsored FI’s  \\n - Nationalized Banks   \\n53,09,300   \\n26.490%  \\nDirectors and Relatives  1,18,800  0.593%  \\nPromoter Companies  27,66,700  13.804%  \\nOther bodies corporate  16,29,400  8.130%  \\nGeneral Public  6,22,500  3.105%  \\nTotal  2,00,42,916  100.00%  \\n \\nIt was noticed that there were discrepancies in the distribution schedule \\nfiled by the company with the CSE and with SEBI. Examination of the \\ndistribution sche dule dated 28/9/00 filed by the company with the CSE \\nrevealed the Non resident shareholding to be 92,63,916 shares (46.17%), \\nNationalized Banks shareholding to be 3939300 shares (19.65%), other Page 3 of 41 body corporates to be 62,47,000 shares (31.17%) and shareholdi ng of \\npromoter companies was not stated.  \\n \\n1.4 In this backdrop , transactions of Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish \\nBiyani were examined. It was observed that these entities transacted \\nheavily in the scrip of DSQ Industries Ltd. From the details of tr ade log \\nand order log  of the exchange  from November 1, 2000 till March 31, 2001, \\nit was observed that shares were not frequently traded. There were no \\nmajor volumes observed till December 2000  and from  December 6 to \\nDecember  18 and December 20 & 21, signif icant volumes were observed. \\nFurther, analysis of price movement revealed that the price of the shares \\nincreased sharply from levels of Rs. 350 - on January 1, 2001 to levels of \\nRs. 450/ - on January 8, 2001 . Significant  trading was also observed on 4 \\ndays i n the period i.e. January 1, 2, 4 and 8, 2001. Further , there was a \\nspurt in the price in November 2000 also and the price started moving up \\nfrom December 19, 2000 onwards. It was further observed that this price \\nincrease was on very low volumes of 100 -500 shares. The trade  analysis  \\nfound  are as under:  \\n \\na) During November 2000 Titan Stock Broking Limited, Shri Harish \\nBiyani, Amritlal Gopalji Thacker, Niraj Balasaria artificially increased \\nthe price of DSQ Industries  through their trades . Titan Stock \\nBroking and Amritlal Thackerji stated that transactions were done \\nfor various DSQ Industries Ltd. Promoter group entities like \\nCooltex, Hulda etc.  \\n \\nb) On December 20, 2000, the price of the scrip increased from \\nRs.298 to Rs.320 when Biyani Securities (P) Ltd traded i n the scrip \\nand in the next trade  when  SMIFS Securities traded, the price  \\nincreased  to Rs. 339 when  a cross deal  between Hulda Properties \\nand SMIFS capital Markets  was entered .   Page 4 of 41  \\n1.5 From the order log and trade log for the period 1/1/01 to 8/1/01, it was \\nrevealed that a large number of trades were carried on only between 2 \\nbrokers – namely Shri Harish Biyani and Amritlal Gopalji Thacker. Further, \\nit was observed that Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. an associate of Shri Harish \\nBiyani entered into cross deals also . On analysis, it was revealed that \\norders were placed at almost the same time by the buying and selling \\nbrokers. There was creation of artificial market and artificial volumes by \\nsynchronization of logging in of orders. Both the buying as well as selling \\norders were put by the buying and selling brokers for same quantity and \\nfor same price  at the same time . The orders were also placed  at prices \\nhigher than  the last traded price. The price was thus artificially increased.  \\n \\n2.0 SHOW CAUSE NOTICE AND REPLY  \\n   \\n2.1 In view of the above, a Show Cause Notice dated 19.02.04 was issued to \\nBiyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani asking them as to why \\ndirections under section 11 and 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with \\nregulation 11 of SEBI (Prohibition of Fra udulent and Unfair Trade \\nPractices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 1995 debarring them \\nfrom dealing in securities for certain period or any other appropriate \\ndirections be not issued for the allegations stated therein.    \\n \\n2.2 Shri Harish Biyani re plied to the said show cause vide his letter dated \\n26.02.04 as under:  \\n \\n1.

These \\ntransactions were also in the nature of synchronization of trades / matched \\norders/ structured trading which ensured matching of orders of seller with \\na specific buyer. These orders were placed simultaneously or within close \\nproximity of each other. From the client code entered by the broker, it Page 14 of 41 appears that the clients are Greenfield and Naina Bart er. These \\ntransactions were to the tune of 2,20,000 shares and comprised 99% of \\nthe traded volumes on that day.  \\n \\n4.4 Similar transactions of high volumes were also observed on other dates \\ni.e. 13/11/00, 15/11/00, 6/12/00, 12/12/00, 13/12/00, 14/12/00, 18/12/0 0, \\n20/12/00 and 21/12/00. Investigation into the order log and trade log on \\nthese dates brought out that transactions on these dates were  also cross \\ndeals of Shri Harish Biyani. These transactions were also in the nature of \\nsynchronization of logging in o f buy and sell orders with buy and sell order \\nwere put within close proximity of each other.    \\n \\n4.5 Therefore , I find that the price was artificially pushed  from Rs. 340 levels \\nto Rs. 452 levels within 4 trading days i.e. an increase of 33% on low \\nvolumes. T rading was concentrated among 3 brokers namely Shri Harish \\nBiyani, Niraj Kumar Balasaria and Amritlal Gopalji Thacker. There was \\ncreation of artificial market and artificial volumes as a result of \\nsynchronization of  logging in / matching of buy and sell o rders.  Orders \\nwere put within a gap of very few seconds by Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. \\nand Shri Harish Biyani for the same quantity and same rate to ensure that \\nbuyers get the desired sellers and vice versa.  \\n \\n4.6 The transactions done by Biyani Securities Pv t. Ltd. and Shri Harish \\nBiyani, in the ‘sell n cash ’ scheme of S HCIL on 27/2/01 and 1/3/01 and \\ncash on payout scheme on 2/3/01 in the shares of DSQ Industries is \\nstrong pointer to the promoter broker nexus between DSQ Group  & Biyani \\nSecurities Pvt. Ltd. an d Shri Harish Biyani. Promoters colluded with Biyani \\nSecurities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani in obtaining finance on account \\nof Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani facing payment crisis \\non the CSE. Funds to the tune of approximately Rs. 34 crore and Rs. 8 \\ncrore were availed on 27/2/01 and 1/3/01 in the ‘sell n cash ’ scheme. Page 15 of 41 These funds were made available on the same date as the transaction \\ndate. Thereafter, funds to the extent of around Rs. 24 crore was availed \\nfor cash on payout transac tions done on 2/3/01. This amount was made \\navailable on 5/3/01 by discounting a post dated cheque given by SHC IL.  \\n \\n4.7 As stated above, the Promoters colluded with Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. \\nand Shri Harish Biyani. Promoter associated entities – Hulda, Squar e D \\nTextiles) credited shares of DSQ Industries to the demat account of Biyani \\nSecurities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani then used these shares in \\naddition to other shares lying with Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri \\nHarish Biyani to avail of the sche mes of S HCIL to obtain immediate sale \\nconsideration in the ‘sell-n-cash ’ scheme of S HCIL as discussed above. \\nBiyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani also discounted post \\ndated cheques given to them by S HCIL under the ‘cash on payout ’ \\nscheme. Biy ani Securities Pvt. Ltd. was empanelled broker for selling the \\nshares. Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. availed finance for self as well as for \\nShri Harish Biyani for selling these shares in the schemes.  \\n \\n4.8 The buying broker was Shri Harish Biyani who was buying shares for DSQ \\ngroup entities. Shares were brought in synchronised deals with buying and \\nselling orders logged in at almost the same time for same rate and \\nquantity with prior understanding to match sell orders with specific buy \\norders. Brokers indulged in  creation of artificial market, creation of artificial \\nvolumes as a result of synchronization / prior intention to matching orders. \\nThere was creation of artificial market and artificial volumes as a result of \\nsynchronization in logging in / matching of bu y and sell orders.  Orders are \\nput within a gap of very few seconds by Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and \\nShri Harish Biyani for the same quantity and same rate with a prior \\nintention to match the orders to ensure that buyers get the desired sellers \\nand vice versa. Shares effectively did not change beneficial ownership by \\nremaining within the DSQ group. Thus, there was circular trading also.

it is noted that the buy as well as the sell orders were \\nplaced in lots of 10,000 shares for the entire quantity ( except for lot of \\n5000 shares on few occasions ). It is noted  that the buy and sell orders \\nwere placed in clos e proximity of time 5 -15 seconds. In view of the fact \\nthat it was an ill -liquid segment and the buy and the sell orders were \\nplaced consecutively with a very short time difference  which is often under \\nfew seconds , it can be said that these trades were sync hronized by the \\nbrokers with prior understanding to match. There was creation of artificial \\nmarket and artificial volumes as a result of synchronization in logging in / \\nmatching of buy and sell orders.  \\n \\n4.11 As observed earlier, Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. sold  as empanelled broker \\na total of 10.4 lakh shares of DSQ . Of these, 8.7 lakh shares were sold for \\nSelf and 1.7 lakh for Shri Harish Biyani. In connection with the sale of 8.7 \\nlakh shares, examination of the demat statement Biyani Securities Pvt. \\nLtd. brou ght out that Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani got \\nshares in their demat account in the following manner:  \\n \\nDate Particulars  Qty \\n21/2/01  By CM Smifs, Physical / 2001146  155000  \\n26/2/01  By Integrated / 10961302  300000  \\n27/2/01  By CM Smifs,  Physical / 2001146  325000  \\n27/2/01  By CM Smifs, Rolling / 2001507  90000  \\nTotal   870000  \\n \\n      F rom the above , it is observed  that 3,00,000 shares were credited in off \\nmarket transfer on 26/2/01 and the remaining were market purchases. \\nInvestigations brought out that the off market transfer of 3,00,000 shares \\nwas from the demat account of Square D Textiles – a DSQ group entity.  \\n Page 23 of 41 4.12 Statement on behalf of Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. admitted that Square D \\ntextiles was never its client and the  shares were received from ‘Hulda ’ who \\nused to give specific instruction for subsequent sale of the shares. It does \\nnot explain why shares came into beneficiary account instead of the pool \\naccount. Regarding credits into its account from SMIFS,  Biyani Sec urities \\n(P) Ltd stated that it purchased 1,55,000 shares in sett no. 146 from \\nmarket through SMIFS Securities. As regards credit on 27/2/01 of 415000 \\nshares, Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. stated that it purchased 90,000 shares \\nfrom the market and the balance  3,25,000 shares were transferred to it \\nfrom ‘Hulda ’. The se 8,70,000 shares were then credited to the account of \\nSHCIL. This shows the nexus between Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri \\nHarish Biyani and the promoters. To facilitate financing Biyani Securi ties \\nPvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani by the ‘sell n cash ’ scheme, 3,00,000 \\nshares were given to them by  the promoter group entities Square D \\nTextiles and 3,25,000 shares by ‘Hulda ’. Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and \\nShri Harish Biyani also had 2,55,000 shar es already available. As regards \\nsale of these 8.7 lakh shares in the ‘sell n cash ’ scheme, Biyani Securities \\nPvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani stated  that they sold the entire lot of \\n8,70,000 shares on behalf of another DSQ group entity – ‘Hulda ’. If share s \\nwere sold on behalf of Hulda  as claimed, , shares should come from the \\nbeneficiary account of Hulda and not from Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and \\nShri Harish Biyani ‘s account.  \\n \\n4.13 As regards sale of 1.7 lakh shares by Shri Harish Biyani, it was found \\nduring the course of investigations that Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri \\nHarish Biyani got shares in their demat account in the following manner:  \\n \\nDate  Particulars  Qty \\n21/2/01   By CM Smifs, Physical / 2001146  170000  \\n Page 24 of 41 Once again, it is seen that shares wer e credited as market purchases. \\nShri Harish Biyani stated that Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish \\nBiyani had purchased these shares from the market through SMIFS. The \\ncontentions by  Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani that they \\nsold 1.7 lakh shares on behalf of DSQ group entity – Hulda  is not tenable \\nsince if shares were to be sold on behalf of Hulda, shares would have \\nbeen sold from the beneficiary account of Hulda and not from broker’s \\naccount.  \\n \\nOn the other side, as buying broker , Shri Harish Biyani stated that Biyani \\nSecurities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani had purchased 1,70,000 shares \\nas part of total 10,40,000 shares purchased by them  for various clients as \\nbelow:  \\n \\nBuying client  Qty (number of shares)  \\nBallona Dealcom  32500  \\nBehala finance  and Investment  21000  \\nCentury Lefin Ltd  1700  \\nKettlewell tracom P Ltd.  250000  \\nDynamic enterprises  29600  \\nGanesh Barter Ltd  26600  \\nRathyatra Sales  428600  \\nGitabali Tracom  250000  \\nTotal  10,40,000  \\n \\n \\n4.14 It may be noted that m any of the buying clients as above have same \\naddress as that of ‘Hulda ’ and also Mr Bhalotia as common director in \\nHulda and the buying clients. Hulda as brought out earlier is promoter \\nassociated entity. Thus , for the entire transactions of 10,40,000 shar es, Page 25 of 41 both the buying as well as the selling clients have linkages with each other \\nand DSQ group.  \\n \\nThese transactions were in the nature of synchronization with buying \\norders and selling orders matched for quantity and price. Orders were put \\nwithin time gap  of few seconds. Both buying and selling brokers were \\nBiyani Securities Pvt.

In view of the fact that \\nboth brokers belong to Biyani group and the synchronization has \\nhappened over so many transactions, the stand taken by either broker is \\nnot tenable. Further, the transactions accounted for the entire trading \\nvolume i.e. 100% on that da te.  \\n \\n4.15 On March 1, 2001, Shri Harish Biyani once again availed of the ‘Sell and \\nCash ’ Scheme through Biyani Securities Pvt.

It is \\npertinent to note that Shri Harish Biyani got shares in its demat account in \\nthe following manner:  \\n \\nDate  Particulars  Qty \\n21/2/01   By Integrated / 10290048  350000  \\n \\n \\nThese shares were credited as off mar ket purchases and were credited \\nfrom the demat account of Hulda. Shri Harish Biyani stated that Biyani \\nSecurities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani sold 2,40,000 shares on behalf \\nof Hulda. If shares were to be sold on behalf of Hulda, shares would have \\nbeen  sold from the beneficiary account of Hulda and not from Biyani \\nSecurities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani’s account. In effect, Shri Harish \\nBiyani used shares of DSQ Industries for availing finance in the ‘sell and \\ncash’ scheme of S HCIL by selling shares  as empanelled broker of S HCIL \\n– i.e. Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd.  \\n \\n4.17 Further,  when Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. was selling shares, Shri Harish \\nBiyani  was the counter party broker . Shri Harish Biyani stated that Biyani \\nSecurities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Bi yani had bought these 2,40,000 \\nshares on behalf of client – Veersali Commodities Ltd. I further note that \\naddress of Veersali is same as that of Hulda and also one of the directors \\nand contact person of this entity is Mr. Manoj Kumar Bhalotia who is also \\na director of M/s. Hulda Properties and Trades Limited – the seller. \\nTherefore Veersali Commodities Limited also appears to be an entity of Page 28 of 41 DSQ group. These further points to nexus between promoters and Biyani \\nSecurities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani whe n it is noticed that shares \\nbought by broker for promoter associated entity – Veersali were sold on \\nthe other side for another promoter associated entities – Hulda. Thus, \\nthere was circular trading also as well as creation of artificial market. \\nBiyani Secu rities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani indulged in creation of \\nartificial market, creation of artificial volumes as a result of synchronization \\nof orders. CSE had subsequently expunged the transaction of 2,40,000 \\nshares amounting to Rs. 8.04 crore  on the  grounds that the transactions \\nwere  non genuine transactions. It is pertinent to note this deal of 2,40,000 \\nshares comprised around 60% of the total traded volume on the said date.  \\n \\n4.18 On March 2, 2001, Shri Harish Biyani once again availed the Cash on Pay \\nout scheme (COP) of SHCIL through Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. which sold \\n7,20,000 shares of DSQ Industries for Shri Harish Biyani. The important \\nfeature of this scheme are as under:  \\n \\na) As per the scheme an investor can sell his shares through one of \\nthe empa nelled brokers of SHCIL and the payment is released to \\nthe investor on the next day of the pay out.  For this purpose a                \\npost-dated cheque (dated to next day of pay out) is issued to the \\ninvestor by SHCIL on the evening of trade day.  \\n \\nb) The fe atures of this scheme are same as SAC and the only \\ndifference being that the payment is released one day after pay out.  \\nAs per SCHIL, this was only a variant of the SAC scheme wherein \\na post dated payment cheque was issued instead of a current date \\ncheque . \\n \\nc) The objective of COP scheme was to help the small investors who \\nare not entertained by the brokers to transact (sell their shares) in Page 29 of 41 the capital market in the risk free environment. Under this scheme \\nthe payment is released one day after the pay out of  the relevant \\nstock exchange.  \\n \\n4.19 Shri Harish Biyani has a DP beneficiary account with SHCIL.  On \\n1.3.2001, he requested SHCIL to sell 2.4 lakh shares of DSQ Industries \\nLtd under ‘sell -n-cash’ scheme.  The shares were sold on the same day by \\nSHCIL in rolling  settlement  No.2001518 of CSE through Biyani  Securities \\nPvt. Ltd., an associate firm of Shri Harish Biyani on whose behalf the trade \\nwas executed.  SHCIL made payment against this transaction to Shri \\nBiyani on the same day after deducting brokerage and s ervice charges \\nfrom the sale proceeds of Rs.8.04 crore.  SHCIL also executed another \\ntransaction for sale of 7.2 lakh shares of DSQ Industries under ‘sell -n-\\ncash’ scheme on behalf of Shri Biyani through Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd in \\nsettlement no.2001159 fo r Rs.24.48 crore on 2.3.2001.  Unlike the earlier \\ntransaction, SHCIL released the payment through a post dated cheque to \\nShri Biyani who discounted the cheque with Indus Ind Bank, Calcutta and \\nreceived the sale proceeds.  \\n \\n4.20 In the transactions of sale of DSQ  Industries shares dated 1.3.01 financed \\nby SHCIL on behalf of its clients Shri Harish Biyani under ‘sell -n-cash’ \\nscheme through Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd and CSE, the counter party \\nbroker was Shri Harish Biyani himself.  In the transaction dated 2.3.2001,  \\nassured / facilitated by SHCIL for Shri Harish Biyani the counter party \\nbrokers were Shri Harish Biyani, Arihant Exim & Doe Jones, CSE, on \\nscrutiny of pay -in/pay -out of settlement no.148 and the rolling settlements \\nfalling due during the same time, classi fied the trades financed / assured \\nby SHCIL through Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd  as trades in the nature of \\naccommodation and expunged these trades.  \\n Page 30 of 41 4.21 Shri Harish Biyani stated that since he was in need of funds he sold DSQ \\nshares to SHCIL and received a post  dated cheque from them and got the \\ncheque discounted.  He further said that SHCIL in turn sold those shares \\nin the market on the same day through Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd  but CSE \\ndid not make payment since the deals were expunged.  \\n \\n4.22 As stated, earlier, o n 2/3/0 1, Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. sold 7,20,000 \\nshares in the ‘cash on payout ’ scheme  of SHCIL . The table showing the \\nvarious trading parties for the transaction is as follows:  \\n \\nSale Quantity  Selling \\nBroker  Selling \\nClient  Price  Amount \\n(Rs.)

Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. \\nwas empanelled broker  of SHCIL  for selling the shares  in the said \\nschemes . Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. availed finance for self as well as for \\nShri Harish Biyani for selling these   shares in the schemes.  The buying \\nbroker was Shri Harish Biyani who was buying shares for DSQ group \\nentities. Shares were brought in synchronised deals with buying and \\nselling orders logged in at almost the same time for same rate and \\nquantity with prior understanding to match sell orders with specific buy \\norders. Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani indulged in \\ncreation of artificial market, creation of artificial volumes as a result of \\nsynchronization / prior intention to matching orders. There was creation of \\nartificial mar ket and artificial volumes as a result of synchronization in \\nlogging in / matching of buy and sell orders.  Orders are  placed within a \\ngap of few seconds by Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani \\nfor the same quantity and same rate to ensure th at buyers get the desired \\nsellers and vice versa. Shares effectively did not change beneficial \\nownership by remaining within the DSQ group. Thus, there was circular \\ntrading also. The transactions also created artificial market.  \\n \\n4.25 I also note that when Biyan i Securities Pvt. Ltd. sold 7,20,000 shares, on \\nthe buying side, Harish Biyani purchased 2,20,000 shares. The balance \\n5,00,000 shares were purchased by the Arihant Exim Scrip Pvt. Ltd. and \\nDoe Jones Investments & Consultants Pvt. Ltd. who were brokers at t he \\nrelevant time and belonged to the D K Singhania group (2,50,000 shares \\neach).  \\n \\n4.26 In appeal no 54 of 2002 – Nirmal Bang Securities Pvt. Ltd vs. SEBI, the \\nHon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal has held as under with regard to \\nsynchronized deals  \\n Page 36 of 41 “BEB has be en charged for synchronized deals with First Global. I have \\nexamined the data provided by the parties on this issue. I find many \\ntransactions between BEB and FGSB. There are many instances of such \\ntransactions. I find the scrip, quantity and price for thes e orders had been \\nsynchronized by the counter party brokers. Such transactions undoubtedly \\ncreate an artificial market to mislead the genuine investors. Synchronized \\ntrading is violative of all prudential and transparent norms of trading in \\nsecurities. Syn chronized trading on a large scale can create false \\nvolumes. The argument that the parties had no means of knowing whether \\nany entity controlled by the client is simultaneously entering any contra \\norder elsewhere for the reason that in the online trading s ystem, \\nconfidentiality of counter parties is ensured, is untenable. It was submitted \\nby the Appellants that it was not possible for the broker to know who the \\ncounter party broker is and that trades were not synchronized but it was \\nonly a coincidence in so me cases. Theoretically this is OK. But when \\nparties decide to synchronize the transaction the story is different. There \\nare many transactions giving an impression that these were all \\nsynchronized, otherwise there was no possibility of such perfect matchin g \\nof quantity price etc. As the Respondent rightly stated it is too much of a \\ncoincidence over too long a period in too many transactions when both \\nparties to the transaction had entered buy and sell orders for the same \\nquantity of shares almost simultaneo usly.”  \\n \\nSuch transactions wherein the buy and sell orders were entered almost \\nsimultaneously  and the time lag is just under few seconds as aforesaid \\nand the transactions are matched in terms of order quantity, price and \\ntime are highly irregular and defea t the purpose of normal order matching \\nsystem in the price discovery process in the exchanges and would also be \\nin violation of Regulation of 4 of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair \\nTrade Practices relating to Securities Market) 1995 which reads as  under: -  \\n Page 37 of 41 Prohibition against market manipulation.  \\n4 No persons shall  \\n(a) effect, take part in, or enter into, either directly or indirectly, \\ntransactions in securities, with the intention of artificially raising or \\ndepressing the prices of securities and  thereby inducing the sale or \\npurchase of securities by any person;  \\n(b) indulge in any act, which is calculated to create a false or misleading \\nappearance of trading on the securities markets;  \\n(c) indulge in any act, which results in reflection of prices o f securities \\nbased on transactions that are not genuine trade transactions;  \\n(d) enter into a purchase or sale of any securities, not intended to effect \\ntransfer of beneficial ownership but intended to operate only as a \\ndevice to inflate, depress, or cause fluc tuation in the market price of \\nsecurities;  \\n \\n4.27 As already noted above, when Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. sold 7.2 lac \\nshares of DSQ Industries, Shri Harish Biyani purchased 2.2 lac shares \\nand the rest were purchased by Arihant Exim Scrip Pvt. Ltd. and Doe \\nJone s Investments & Consultants Pvt. Ltd.  It is therefore, concluded that \\nthe brokers viz. Shri Harish Biyani and Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd acted in \\nconcert with the promoters of DSQ Group for creation of artificial market \\nand rise in prices by entering into irregular transactions by way of \\nsynchronized trades and cross deals in which the order, quantity, time and \\nprices are matched, financing of trades through the schemes of SHCIL, \\netc. as discussed above  \\n \\nActing in concert is something about which actual evi dence is normally \\ndifficult to come. The Supreme Court had dealt with the issue in the case \\nof CIT vs. East Coast Commercial Co. Ltd. AIR (1967) SC 768 (Kedia \\nFamily case) in the context of Section 23A of the Indian Income Tax Act, \\n1922 wherein the questio n was whether Kedia family had acted in concert Page 38 of 41 to control the affairs of the concerned company. In the facts of that case, \\nthere was no evidence of any overt act showing that they were acting in \\nconcert and thereby constituted and acted as a block.  \\n \\n In para 14 of the judgement, the SC observed as follows:  \\n \\n“…..  It is sufficient, if having regard to their relation, etc., their conduct and \\ntheir common interest, that it may be inferred that they must be acting \\ntogether, evidence of actual concerted acting  is normally difficult to obtain, \\nand is not insisted upon.” (p.772)  \\n \\nHence, it is clear from the above that Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri \\nHarish Biyani had together indulged in creation of artificial market, artificial \\nprice rise, giving misleading  appearance of trades and hence have \\nviolated Regulation  4 of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade \\nPractices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 1995 as aforesaid.  \\n \\n4.28 The method and manner of execution of these transactions whereby the \\norder price, quantity and time are matched was highly irregular and \\nagainst the normal price discovery mechanism in Stock Exchanges.   It \\nwas contended that Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd and Harish Biyani are \\nseparate and distinct entities.  While the former is a  company registered \\nunder the Companies Act, 1956, the latter is an individual broking firm.  As \\nsuch, it was contended that both of them cannot be clubbed together for \\nthe aforesaid  show cause notice for  irregular transactions.  \\n \\n4.29 The JPC Report dated 19. 12.2002 on stock market scam  at para 6.21 \\nobserved  that a number of large brokers have more than one card in CSE \\nwhich are either in the name of their family members or companies where \\nthey are  major shareholders.  Shri Harish Biyani and Biyani Securities  Pvt \\nLtd are amongst such brokers.  Page 39 of 41  \\n4.30 The net outstanding position of Shri Harish Biyani and Biyani Securities \\nPvt Ltd to the CSE where they were declared defaulters by the Exchange \\nare as under  : \\n(Rs.

One of the reasons for the payment  \\nproblem at CSE was building up of large outstanding positions by few \\nbrokers in few scrips mainly in HFCL and DSQ and volatility in the prices \\nduring the relevant period.           \\n \\nIn this context, the Hon’bl e Supreme Court decision in Delhi Development \\nAuthority vs Skipper Construction C o. Pvt Ltd. (1996) 4 Comp LJ 233 (SC) \\n… AIR 1996 SC 2005 that (para 27 at page 247 of COMP LJ ) may be \\nreferred to.  \\n \\n“The concept of corporate entity was evolved to encourage and promote \\ntrade and commerce but not to commit illegalities or to defraud people. \\nWhere , therefore, the corporate character is employed for the purpose of \\ncommitting illegality or defrauding others , the court would ignore the \\ncorporate character and wi ll look at the reality behind the corporate veil so \\nas to enable it to pass appropriate orders to do justice between the parties \\nconcerned.  The fact that an individual and members of his family have \\ncreated several corporate bodies would not prevent the c ourt from treating Page 40 of 41 all of them as one entity belonging to and controlled by that individual and \\nfamily. If it is found that these corporate bodies are merely cloaks behind \\nwhich lurks the individual and /or members of his family and that the \\ndevice of inco rporation was really a ploy adopted for committing illegalities \\nand /or to defraud people”  (underlining supplied).  \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \\nActing in concert is something a bout which actual evidence is normally \\ndifficult to come. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of CIT vs East \\nCoast Commercial Co.Ltd. AIR (1967) SC 768 (Kedia Family case) in the \\ncontext of Section 23A of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 wherein the \\nquest ion was whether Kedia family had acted in concert to control the \\naffairs of the concerned company.  In the facts of that case, there was no \\nevidence of any overt act showing that they were acting in concert  and \\nthereby constituted and acted as a block.  I n para 14 of the judgment, the \\nSC observed as follows:  \\n“….. if the members of the Kedia family form a block and had more than \\n75 per cent of the voting power, it was not necessary to prove that they  \\nactually exercised controlling interest. It is the holdi ng in aggregate of a \\nmajority of the shares issued by a person or persons acting in concert  in \\nrelation to the affairs of the company which establishes the existence of a \\nblock.  It is sufficient, if having regard to their relation, etc., their conduct \\nand their common interest, that it may be inferred that they must be acting \\ntogether, evidence of actual concerted acting is normally difficult to obtain, \\nand is not insiste d upon.” (p.772)(italics added).   \\n4.31 The evidence of connected circumstances and prepond erance of \\nprobabilities, common course of natural events and combination of facts \\ncreating network and artificial volumes gives rise to a reasonable \\ninference that Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani did not act Page 41 of 41 in good faith and without neg ligence when they had executed these \\ntransactions.  \\n  \\nThe standard of proof required in a proceeding of this nature is at variance \\nwith the standard of proof required in criminal cases. It is sufficient if the \\npreponderance of probabilities suggests toward s the indulgence of the \\ndelinquent in the misconduct.  The strict rules of Evidence Act and proof \\nbeyond reasonable doubt are not applicable to a proceeding of this nature. \\nThe Supreme Court’s decision in Gulabchand vs. Kudilal AIR, 1966, SC \\n1734 and the d ecision of the Special Court for trial of offences relating to \\ntransactions in securities in the matter of National Housing Bank versus \\nANZ Grindlays Bank, 1998 (2 ) LJ 153 is relied upon in this regard.  \\n \\n5.0 ORDER  \\n \\nNow, therefore, having regard to the na ture and gravity of the charges \\nestablished against Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani, I \\nhereby, in exercise of powers under Section 11(4), 11B  of SEBI Act, \\n1992,  and Regulation 11 of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair \\nTrade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003,  prohibit \\nBiyani Securities Pvt.

(Cril) Vol. 1 are not properly complied with. It 16 \\n has also been found that directions of the Hon‟ble Court regarding processing of \\ncomplaints are not being observed properly. Administrative correspondence \\nregarding a complaint against particular officer of the district is not kept in the file \\nof that part icular officer, maintained in the administrative office of that judgeship.  \\n Even after sufficient directions issued in this regard vide C.L. No. 83/Xf -21 \\ndated 31st May, 1971 and C.L. NO. 5/Admn. (B) Vig. Dated 23rd March, 1971, no \\nuniform practice has be en found for keeping the files of administrative \\ncorrespondence regarding complaint. This result into great difficulty in locating all \\nthe complaints made against the particular officer in a particular district and leads \\nto corrupt practice.  \\n Reiterating the above -mentioned C.L.

NO. 83/Xf -21 dated 31st May, 1971.  \\n While forwarding complaints against Judicial Officers to the Court, District \\nJudges should give their comments also and enquire into the complaints and take \\nsuitable action in the matter.  \\nC.L. No. 5/Admn. (B) Vig. Dated 23rd March, 1971.  \\n On all complaint s against an officers or a member of the staff sent for \\nenquiry and report, the District Judges should send complete report. It should \\ninvariably be to the point, thorough and objective. Whenever necessary the record \\nshould also be perused while sending th e report and corrupt and inefficient \\nofficers/ officials should not be shielded. A clear opinion should always be \\nexpressed on the allegations made. If the allegations made are in respect of a \\npending or it decided case the opinion should be expressed in c lear words but \\nwithout being too critical of judicial independence of an officer has not to be \\ncurbed in any way. What has to be seen is whether the order passed is or is not \\nreasonable and also whether it was passed after taking into consideration all the  \\nfacts and circumstances of the case.  17 \\n   \\n10.

Thus it is \\ndirected by Hon‟ble Court that all the courts of the State which a re issuing the \\nrelease orders or which are likely to issue release orders, they must incorporate all \\nthe details as per above mentioned circular letters.  \\n Hon‟ble Court has also expressed its anguish over increasing number of \\ncorrection applications being  filed in the High Court due to some subordinate \\ncourts insisting upon the pairokars of prisoners to get full description of offences, \\ncrime number and Section of I.P.C. and other Acts incorporated in the bail orders \\nwhich are being passed by Hon‟ble Court  in spite of a Case No. or S.T. No. of the \\ntrial court having been mentioned in them for proper reference and identification.  \\n Thus it is directed by Hon‟ble Court that if there is sufficient reference of the \\nconcerned case or S.T. No. in which bail is be ing granted by this Court any \\ninsistence on the part of courts below for also getting other details incorporated in \\nthe bail order, canot be held to be justified. From the reference of the Case/S.T. \\nNumber other details can be ascertained by the subordinat e courts from their own \\nrecord which normally remains available with them and in case any uncertainty \\nstill exists in the mind of any Presiding Officer he may ask for any other \\ninformation to be furnished by the applicant instead of rejecting his applicati on for \\nwant of those details in the bail order of the Court and forcing him to get the same \\ncorrected.  \\n I am, therefore, to request you to kindly circulate above mentioned judgment \\ndated 12.09.2012 (copy enclosed herewith) passed in Criminal Appeal No. 40 72 of 54 \\n 2005, Chandrama @ Magram Yadav & Another Vs.

EXPEDITIONUS DISPOSAL  \\n \\n(i) Fast tracking of cases relating to women, juvenile and Prevention of \\nCorruption Act, 1988.  \\n \\nC.L. No. 23/Admin. G -II dated: Allahabad 22.08.2013.  \\n \\n \\n A serious concern has been shown by the Hon‟ble Apex Court over the \\nmounting pendency of cases relating to offences against women, juveniles and 64 \\n covered under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 over a period of time, may \\nbe due to lack of deterrent eff ect on account of slow place of grinding of wheels of \\njustice. An effective and expeditious dispensation justice would go a long way in \\narresting not only the arrears of cases but in alleviating the affliction of society \\nfrom crime against women and childr en which otherwise would have a deleterious \\neffect. Corruption is a malady which calls for preventive, punitive and reformatory \\napproach. The punitive action against the guilty protects the society from potential \\noffenders. Modern civil society is in great  need of corruption free society, therefore \\ndelay in disposal of these cases would not help in arresting this evil.  \\n Therefore, upon consideration of the matter, the Hon‟ble court has desired \\nthat the cases relating to crime against women, juveniles and c overed under the \\nPrevention of Corruption Act be fast tracked and be taken up for hearing and \\ndisposal on priority basis.  \\n I am therefore to request you to kindly direct the officers under your \\nadministrative control to take up the cases of the above cate gory for hearing on \\npriority basis and fast track their disposal.  \\n I am further directed to request you to kindly send a consolidated monthly \\nreport of your judgeship regarding pendency and disposal of the cases of above \\nnature every month which must reac h the Hon‟ble court by 7th day of the month \\nfollowing for being submitted to the Hon‟ble apex court. The 1st such report must \\nreach court from the month of August which should reach by 7th day in the month \\nof September positively.  \\n Kindly treat this as mo st urgent.  \\n \\n9.

The Station House Officer of the concerned Police \\nStation shall ensure that each warrant of arrest issued by the Court, when \\nreceived is duty entered in the said regist er and is formally entrusted to a 66 \\n responsible officer for execution;  \\n(h) Ordinarily, the Courts should not give a long time for return of execution of \\nwarrants, as experience has shown that warrants are prone to misuse if they \\nremain in control of executing ag encies for long;  \\n(i) On the date fixed for the return of the warrant, the Court must insist upon a \\ncompliance report on the action taken thereon by the Station House Officer \\nof the Concerned Police Station of the Officer -incharge of the concerned \\nagency;  \\n(j) The r eport on such warrants must be clear, cogent and legible and duly \\nforwarded by a superior police officer, so as to facilitate fixing or \\nresponsibility in case of misuse;  \\n(k)  In the event of warrant for execution beyond jurisdiction of the Court \\nissuing it, pr ocedure laid down in Sections 78 and 79 of the Code must be \\nstrictly and scrupulously followed; and  \\n(l) In the event of cancellation of the arrest warrant by the Court, the order \\ncancelling warrant shall be recorded in the case file and the register \\nmaintaine d. A copy thereof shall be sent to the concerned authority, \\nrequiring the process to be retuned unexecuted forthwith.

State of U.P. in respect of \\nputting number of cases of special category like Gangster Act, SC & ST \\nAct etc. and adopting correct procedure in initiatio ns of proceedings \\nunder Section 446 Cr. PC.  \\n \\nC.L. No. 05/ 2012/Admin. ‗G -II‘ Dated 16.1.2012.  \\n \\nWhile deciding the above noted Criminal Appeal no. 6776 of 2007 Ajant \\nSingh V. State of U.P. the Hon‟ble Court has noticed that different practice is \\nbeing follo wed in different Judgeship for putting number of cases like Gangster \\nAct, SC & ST Act etc. and also that the Subordinate Courts are not following the \\ncorrect procedure while initiating th3e proceedings under Section 446 of Cr. PC for \\nrecovery of the amount  after forfeiture. It has been desired by the Hon‟ble Court \\nthat uniform practice be followed throughout the entire State. With above object in \\nmind the Hon‟ble Court has observed that there are two types of Criminal cases \\nwhich are to be tried by the Sess ions Judge including Additional Sessions Judge \\nand Special Judge. The First category of cases are Sessions trial under the \\nProvisions of Indian Penal Code committed to the Court of Sessions by the \\nMagistrate under the provisions of Section 209 Code of Cr. PC and in the second \\ncategory there are cases which are to be tried under the provisions of enactment of \\nthe State Government and Central Government by which the cases are being filed \\ndirectly before designated Special Judge like the Gangster Act/ SC & ST cases, \\nElectricity Cases etc. The cases which are committed by the Magistrate are to be \\nreceived in the officer Sessions Judge and all the cases which are committed to the \\ncourt of Sessions are numbered in register maintained by the Sessions Judge \\nwhereas the cases of special category are not to be received in the officer of the \\nSessions Judge, but are to be received by the office of Special Judge (Gangster/SC \\n& ST Act etc.) and these cases of special category which are not received after \\ncommittal must be numbered as criminal cases and which are not received after \\ncommittal must be numbered as criminal cases and not the Sessions trial. The \\nprocedure of Sessions trial and criminal cases is also different.  \\nThe Hon‟ble Court further observed that most of the judicial officers are not \\nfollowing the correct procedure after forfeiture of the bail bonds and they are not \\nputting separate number of misc. criminal cases while initiating proceedings under \\nSection 446 Cr. PC for recovery of the amount of bail bonds and  some of the \\njudicial officers continue to pass orders regarding the recovery of amount under \\nSection 446 Cr.PC in the file of Sessions trial. Whereas the law and rules provide \\nthat the proceedings under Section 446 Cr.PC must be registered separately and \\nseparate number must be put to such proceedings. It is highly improper to continue 68 \\n recovery proceedings under Section 446 Cr.PC in the file of Sessions trial without \\nputting separate misc. number of such file.    \\nIn view of the above observations of Hon‟bl e Court, I am directed to \\ncommunicate that from now onwards all the cases pertaining to special category \\nsuch as Gangster/SC& ST Act etc. shall not be registered as Sessions trial rather \\nsuch cases shall be registered as „Special Criminal Cases‟ so as to d istinguish them \\nfrom such category of cases which are being received after committal and further \\nin drawing proceedings under Section 446 Cr.P.C., every such proceedings shall be \\nregistered as a separate misc. case.  \\nTherefore, while enclosing a copy of th e above noted judgment I am to \\nrequest you to kindly bring the contents of this Circular letter to the notice of all \\nthe judicial officers working in the judgeship under your administrative control and \\nto ensure that the direction given above are strictly followed by them.  \\n \\n(v) Directions issued by Hon‘ble Supreme Court of India in Writ Petition \\n(C)  No. 75  of 2012 – Bachpan Bachao Andolan vs. Union of India & \\nOrs. \\n  \\nC.L.

No. 04/2012/ Admin. ‗G -II‘ Dated: Allahabad 16.01.2012.  \\nI am directed to inform you that Hon‟ble the Supreme Court, in the \\ncaptioned matter, has framed following guidelines for a graded scheme of \\nimposing costs on parties who unduly delay compounding of the offences as \\ncontemplated by Section 147 of the Negotiable I nstruments Act, 1881 (for short \\n“the Act”) and also directed for controlling the filing of multiple complaints that \\nare relatable to the same transaction under Section 138 of the Act: - \\nThe Guidelines  \\n(a) That directions can be given that the Writ of Summons be  suitably modified \\nmaking it clear to the accused that he could make an application for \\ncompounding of the offences at the first of second hearing of the case and \\nthat if such an application is made, compounding may be allowed by the \\ncourt without imposing  any costs on the accused.   \\n(b) If the accused does not made an application for compounding as aforesaid 70 \\n then if an application for compounding is made before the Magistrate at a \\nsubsequent stage, compounding can be allowed subject to the condition that \\nthe a ccused will be required to pay 10% of the cheque amount to be \\ndeposited as a condition for compounding with the Legal Services Authority, \\nor such authority as the Court deems fit.  \\n(c) Similarly, if the application for compounding is made before the Sessions \\nCourts or a High Court in revision or appeal, such compounding may be \\nallowed on the condition that the accused pays 15% of the cheque amount by \\nway of costs.  \\n(d) Finally, if the application for compounding is made before the Supreme \\nCourt, the figure would increase of 20% of the cheque amount.  \\nLet it also be clarified that any costs imposed in accordance with these \\nguidelines should be deposited with the Legal Services Authority operating \\nat the level of the Court before which compounding take place. For ins tance, \\nin case of compounding during the pendency of proceedings before a \\nMagistrate‟s Court or a Court of Sessions, such costs should be deposited \\nwith the District Legal Services Authority. Likewise, costs imposed in \\nconnection with composition before th e High Court should be deposited \\nwith the State Legal Services Authority and those impose in connection with \\ncomposition before the Supreme Court should be deposited with the \\nNational Legal Services Authority.  \\n \\nTherefore, while enclosing herewith a copy of  the Order dated 03.05.2010 \\npassed by the Hon‟ble Apex Court in the above mentioned case you are requested \\nto kindly circulate this circular letter to all the Judicial Officers under you \\nsupervision and control for their information and necessary complianc e. \\n \\n(viii) Compliance of the direction given by Hon‘ble High Court in Criminal \\nMisc.

CRIME AGAINST WOMEN  \\n \\n(i) Compliance of the direction given by Hon‘ble Supreme Court in Writ \\nPetition (Civil) N o. 559 of 1994 – R.D. Upadhyay Vs. State of A.P. and \\nothers.  \\n \\nC.L. No. 44/Admin. ―G -II‘ Dated: Allahabad 07.12.2013  \\n \\n While enclosing herewith a copy of the order dated 01.08.2013 passed by \\nHon‟ble Supreme Court in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 559 of 1994 titled R.D. \\nUpadhyay Vs. State of A.P. & Ors., I am directed to say that Hon‟ble Apex Court \\nhas expressed deep concern ov er the plight of women under trial prisoners and that \\nof their children languishing in various jails with their mothers. Hon‟ble Apex \\nCourt has directed to impress upon all the courts of the country dealing with cases \\nof women prisoners whose children are in prison with their mothers to give priority \\nto such cases and to decide their cases expeditiously.  \\n Hon‟ble Court has directed in this regard that the District & Sessions Judge \\nshall obtain quarterly returns from the Jail Superintendent in regard to num ber of \\nwomen convicts who are lodged in jail either with children or without children \\nmentioning the age of the child. The District Judges should ensure that on receipt \\nof information necessary steps are taken for expeditious disposal of cases by \\ninforming  the courts where these cases are pending.   \\n I am, therefore, to request you to kindly issue necessary directions along \\nwith the aforesaid Judgment and order of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court to all the 72 \\n Judicial Officers working under you supervision and contr ol to give priority to \\ncases of women prisoners whose children are in prison with their mother and to \\ndecide such cases expeditiously.   \\n \\n(ii) Regarding use of the provisions under Section 309 and 327 of the Code \\nof Criminal Procedure during the trial of c ases involving heinous crimes \\nsuch as rape.  \\n \\nC.L.

This has become imperative as continuing \\ndelay in dispensation of justice in such cases, may erode the faith of peopl e in the \\ncredibility of criminal justice system. The need of the hour then is to respond by \\nconducting trials without adjournment as far as possible and by bringing culprits to \\njustice in the shortest possible time.  \\n \\n \\n(iii) Strict compliance of Sec. 309 o f Cr.P.C.  \\nC.L.

(vide Act No. 45 of 1978, effective from 18.12.1978).  \\n(b)  No adjournment shall be granted at the request of a party, except \\nwhere the circumstances are beyond the control of that arty;  \\n(c) The fact that the pleader of a party is engaged in another Court, shall \\nnot be a ground for adjournment:  \\n(d) where a witness is present in Court but a Party or his pleader is not \\npresent or the party or his pleader though present in Court, is not ready to \\nexamine or cross examine the witness, the Court may, if thinks fit, record the \\nstatement of the witness and  pass such orders as it think fit dispensing with \\nthe examination in chief or cross -examination of the witness, as the case \\nmay be (vide amendment by Act No. 5 of 2009, effective from 1.11.2010).  \\n(5) Adjournment or postponement can only be made, in a prope r case, on \\npayment of sufficient costs on the party seeking the adjournment.

If for any reason, a case has to be adjourned or postponed, intimation \\nshould be given forthwith to both sides and immediate steps be taken to stop the \\nwitnesses and to secure their presence on the adjourned date.  \\n(9) On receipt of the order of commitment the case should be posted for trial to \\nas early a date as possible, sufficien t time, say three weeks, being allowed for \\nsecuring the witnesses. Sufficient time should be allowed for each case so that one \\ncase does not telescope into the next.

JURISDICTION  \\n \\n(i) Compliance of the directions given by Hon‘ble Court in Criminal \\nAppeal No. 5005/2009, Smt. Manbhawati Pathak vs. State of U.P. read \\nwith Criminal Appeal  No. 5298/2009, Shashi Ranjan Pandey vs. State of \\nU.P. \\n \\nC.L. No. 27/Admin. G -II dated: Allahabad 04.09.2013.  \\n \\n The Hon‟ble Court while considering the above mentioned Criminal \\nAppeals has noticed that the trial courts mostly manned by Additional Sessions 75 \\n Judges are being described by them as Special Court (E.C. Act), N.D.P.S. Act etc. \\nwhile pronouncing the judgments in sessions trials which is not in accordance with \\nthe provisions given in section 9 of Cr.P.C., as the court of sessions has to be \\nmanned by a Sessions Judge, jurisdiction of which may also be exercised by an \\nAdditional Sessions Judge. The said scheme of allocating the jurisdiction in \\nCr.P.C. does not recognize any Special Judge or any Special Sessions Judge in \\nrespect of session trials, theref ore use of such designation creates great confusion \\nas no such nomenclatures are assigned to a court of sessions which carries out \\nsessions trials as per Chapter XVIII of the Cr.P.C. No Special Judge under any Act \\nis empowered to try an offence which is sh own triable by the court of sessions as \\nper the schedule of the Cr.P.C., however it is true that the special court so \\nconstituted under an Special Act may have to be manned by either a Sessions \\nJudge or an Additional Sessions Judge. Therefore the Hon‟ble C ourt has directed \\nthat the officers be instructed not to describe their courts by names which creates \\nconfusion or which does not really reflect their constitution as per Cr.P.C. while \\ndelivering judgments in sessions cases.  \\n Upon consideration of the abov e judgment and order of the Hon‟ble Court, it \\nhas been resolved to circulate the copy of the said judgment among all the offices \\nworking under your administrative control for their necessary guidance and \\ncompliance.  \\n Therefore, enclosing herewith a copy o f the said judgment and order, I am to \\nrequest you to kindly circulate a copy of the same among all the offices of your \\njudgeship for strict compliance of the same.  \\n \\n \\n \\n(ii) Expeditious disposal of the trial of SC/ST Cases  \\n \\nC.L. No. 12/Admin. ‗G -II‘ Dated: Allahabad 28.04.2014  \\n In continuation of Court‟s earlier circular letter no. 07 dated 20.02.2007, I \\nam directed to request to impress upon all the Judicial Officers working under your \\nadministrative control to conclude all criminal trials including the tri al of SC/ST \\nCases as early as possible with the help of Amended provision of Section 309 of \\nCode of Criminal Procedure.  \\n I am, therefore, to request you to kindly circulate the aforesaid direction of \\nHon‟ble Court to all the Judicial Officers working unde r your supervision and \\ncontrol for their information and necessary compliance.  \\n \\n(iii) To ensure speedy trial of cases relating to atrocities on Scheduled Castes \\nand Scheduled Tribes.  76 \\n  \\nC.L. No. 7/2007/Admin. ‗G‘ Dated: Allahabad 20.02.2007  \\n The Government  of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, New Delhi has \\nnominated to the Court that the Parliamentary Committee on the Welfare of \\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes on the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, while \\nconsidering the matter pertaining to atrocities on S cheduled Castes and Scheduled \\nTribes and patters of social crimes towards them recommended as under:  \\n“The Committee are aware that one of the terms of reference of the \\nMalimath Committee was to suggest a round system of managing, on \\nprofessional lines, th e pendency of cases at investigation and trial stages and \\nmaking the Police, the Prosecution and the Judicial accountable for delays in \\ntheir respective domains. The Committee feel that the time taken in disposal \\nof atrocity cases should be considerably cu t short. The Ministry of Law and \\nJustice should look into this matter and take necessary steps. The Committee \\nhope that the Sessions Courts notified on special courts would given up top \\npriority to atrocity cases which in the opinion of the Committee will help in \\nbringing the pendency down.”  \\n Therefore, in this regard while enclosing herewith a copy of D.O. No. \\n11017/60/2001 -JUS(M), dated December 22, 2006 of Sri Rajiv Agarwal, \\nAdditional Secretary, Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, New Delhi, \\nI am directed to request you to impress upon the concerned Courts to ensure \\nspeedy trial of cases pertaining to atrocities committed against Scheduled Casters \\nand Sche4duled Tribes, so as to minimize the pendency of such cases.  \\n \\nD.O. No. 11017/60/2001 -JUS (M), dated December 22, 2006.  \\n The Parliamentary Committee on the Welfare of Scheduled Castes and \\nScheduled Tribes on the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Social Justice and \\nEmpowerment and Ministry of Tribal Affairs, while considering the matter \\npertaining to atrocities on SCs and STs and pattern of social crimes towards them \\nrecommended as under:   \\n “The Committee are aware that one of the terms of reference of the \\nMalimath Committee was to suggest a sound system of managing, on professional \\nlines, the pendency of cases at investigation and trial stages and making the Police, \\nthe prosecution and the judiciary accountable for delays in their respective \\ndomains. The Committee feels that the time taken in disposal of atrocity cases \\nshould be considerabl y cut short. The Ministry of Law and Justice should look into \\nthis matter and take necessary steps. The Committee hope that the Sessions Courts \\nnotified as Special Courts would give up top priority to atrocity cases which in the \\nopinion of the Committee wi ll help in bringing the pendency down.”  \\n2. The Government give an Action Taken Reply as under: - 77 \\n  “The recommendation of the Committee has been noted. The Government \\nwould endeavour to impress upon the Courts and the law enforcing agencies to \\nensure speedy trial of atrocity cases s as to bring down the pendency.”  \\n I shall, therefore, be grateful if the matter is placed before the Chief Justice \\nof your High Court for such action as he deems fit.  \\n \\n12.

The provisions of \\ns. 4(b) and s. 23(f) are unconstitutional. Per PATANJALI \\nSASTRI C. J. and DAs J~The whole of the Bihar Land \\nReforms Act of 1950, including the provisions contained in \\ns. 4(b) and s. 23(f) is constitutional and valid. \\nPer PATANJALI SASTRI C. J., MAHAJAN, MuKHERJEA, D1i.s \\nand CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR JJ.-(i) The Bihar Land Reforms \\nAct, XXX of 1950, is not a law in respect of a matter mention\\xad\\ned in entry 18 of List II, viz., \"lands and land tenures\", but a \\nlaw in respect of \"acquisition of property\", a matter covered \\nby entry 36 of List II. \\n(ii) The obligation to pay compensation for property \\nacquired by the State is not an obligation imposed by entry 36 \\nof List II read by itself or in conjunction with entry 42 of List III \\nor by the spirit of the Constitution. Consequently, an objection \\nto the validity of a statute in resixct of acquisition of property \\non the ground that it does not provide for payment of compen\\xad\\nsation is an objection on the ground that it contravenes the \\nprovisions of. art. 31(2) and the jurisdiction of the Court to \\nentertain such an objection in respect of a statute mentioned in \\nthe Ninth Schedule to the Constitution is barred by art. 31(4), \\nart. 31-A and art. 31-B of the Constitution. Per DAs /.-\\nAssuining that the obligation to pay compensation is also \\nimplicit in entry 36 of List II, in itself or read with entry 42 of \\nList III, even then the validity of the Act cannot be questioned \\nby reason of arts. 31( 4), 31-A and 31-B. \\n(iii) Section 32(2) of the Act which empowers the State \\nGovernment to frame rules providing for \"the proportion in \\nwhich compeinsation shall be payable in cash and in bonds and \\n·the manner of payment pf such compensation\" does not involve \\nany delegation of legislative powers especially as the legislature \\nhas itself provided in s. 32(2) that the compensation shall be \\npayable in cash or in bonds . or partly in cash and partly in \\nbonds and fixed the number of instalments in which it should be \\npaid. The words \"subject to\" in entry 36 of List II only mean \\nthat whenever a law is made by a State Legislature in exercise \\nof its legislative power under entry 36, that law will be subject \\nto the provisions of a law made by the Parliament under entry 42 \\nof List III. The words do not mean that when a State makes a \\nlaw under entry 36 it must lay down the principles on which \\ncompensation payable for property acquired is to be determined \\nand the form and manner in which it should be given. \\n(iv) Entries in the Lc;gislative Lists arc merely of an enabl-\\ning character. The power conferred thereunder on the legisla-\\ntures is not coupled with any duty on the legislature to exercise .. \\n-\\n• \\n• .. -\\'.S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 891 \\n:such power and the principle laid down in /ulius v. Bishop of \\nOxford [5 A.C. 214] has, therefore, no application to the Lists. \\nPer PATANJALI SASTRI C. J., MuKHERJEA and DAs JJ. \\n(MAHAJAN and CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR JJ. dissenting).-The \\nexistence of a public purpose as a pre-requisite to the exercise of \\nthe power of compulsory acquisition is an essential and integral \\npart of the provisions of art. 31(2) and an infringement of such \\na provision cannot be put forward as a ground for questioning \\nthe validity of an Act providing for compulsory acquisition. \\nDAs. J.-Even assuming that the necessity of a public purpose is \\nimplied in entry 36 of List II and/or entry 42 of List III also, \\narts. 31 ( 4), 31-A and 31-B would still protect the Act from be\\xad\\ning questioned on the ground that the acquisition was not for a \\npublic purpose. In any case the impugned Act is supported by a \\npublic purpose. \\nPer MAHAJAN and CHANDRASEKHARA A1YAR JJ.-The scope \\n-0f art. 31(4) is limited to the express provisions of art. 31(2) \\nand though the courts cannot examine the extent or adequacy \\n-0f the provisions of compensation contained in any law dealing \\nwith the acquisition of property compulsorily, yet the provisions \\nof art. 31 ( 4) do not in any way debar the court from consider• \\ning whether the acquisition is for a public purpose. Though the \\nmain object of the Act, viz., the acquisition of estates, is for a \\npublic purpose, the acquisition of arrears of rent due to the \\nzamindars on payment of 50 per cent. of their value cannot be held \\nto be for a public purpose and sec. 4 clause (b) of the Act is there-\\nfore unconstitutional and void. Per MuKHERJEA J.-Assuming \\nthat art. 31 ( 4) relates to everything that is provided for in \\nart. 31 (2) either in express terms or even impliedly and conse-\\nquently thei question of the existence of a public purpose is not \\njusticiable, as the real object of sec. 4, clause (b) is to deprive the \\nman of his money, which is not a subject-matter for acquisition \\nunder the powers of eminent domain, without giving anything \\nin exchanm under the guise of acting under entry 4 2 the legis-\\nlature has in truth and substance evaded and nullified its provi-\\nsions altogether and sec. 4 clause (b) is therefore unconstitutional \\n\"\\'\\' and void. \\n• PATANJALI SAsTRI C. J.-Whatever may be the pc>1t10n as \\nregards the acquisition of money as such it is not correct to say \\nthat a law made under entry 36 of List II cannot authorise \\nacquisition of choses in action like arrears \\'of rent due from the \\ntenants which are covered by the term \"property\" used in that \\nentry and in art. 31. The view that .a payment in cash or in \\ngovernment bonds of half the amount of such arrears leaves the \\nzamindar without compensation for the balance is equally \\nfallacious. Section 4 clause (b) is not therefore ultra vires or un-\\nconstitutional. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. 1952 \\nThe Sta~ of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhirajaSir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. 892 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952J \\nPer MAHAJAN, MuKHERJEA and CHANDRASEKHAllA AIYAR JJ. \\n(PATANJALI SAsTRI C. J. and DAs J. dissenting).-&xtion 23 (b) \\nof the Act which provides for a deduction on a percentage basis \\nout of the gross asserts for \"costs of works of benefit to the \\nraiyat\", is ostensibly enacted under entry 42 of List III, but it is \\nmerely a colourable piece of legislation, a mere device to reduce \\nthe gross assets, which does not really come under entry 42 and \\nis unconstitutional. PATANJALI SAsTRI C. J. and DAs J.-The \\nzamindars are under an obligation to maintain and repair the \\nminor irrigation works in their villages which arc beneficial to \\nthe raiyats and the cost of such works is therefore a perfectly \\nlegitimate deduction in computing the net assets of the estate \\nand sec. 23(f) is not unconstitutional. Further, as a payment of \\ncompensation is not a justiciable issue in the case of the im~ \\npugned statute, having regard to arts. 31 (4), 31-A and 31-B, it \\nis not open to the Court to enquire whether a reduction which \\nresults in reducing the compensation is unwarranted and there· \\nfore a fraud on the Constitution. \\nPer MAHAJAN J.-The phrase \"public purpose\" hao to be \\nconstrued according to the spirit of the times in which the parti-\\ncular legislation is enacted and so construed, acquisition of estates \\nfor the purpose of preventing the concentration of huge blocks of \\nland in the hands of a few individuals and to do away with \\nintermediaries is for a public purpose. \\n-Per DAs J.-No hard and fast definition can be laid down \\nas to what is a \"public purpose\" as tho concept has been \\nrapidly changing in all countries, but it is clear that it is the \\npresence of the element of general interest of the community in \\nan object or an aim that transforms such object or aim into a \\npublic purpose, and whatever furthers the general interest \\nof the community as opposed to the particular interest of the \\nindividual must be regarded as a pnblic purpose. \\nAPPEALS under article 132(1) of the Constitution \\nof India from the judgment and decree dated 12th \\nMarch, 1951, of the High Court of Judicature at Patna \\n(Shearer, Reuben and Das JJ.) in Title Suits Nos. 1 to \\n3 and Mis.

P. Act No. I of 1951) \\n(hereinafter referred to as the Bihar Act, the Madhya \\nPradesh Act and the Uttar Pradesh Act, respectively). \\nThe common aim of these statutes, generally speak-\\ning, is to abolish zamindaries and other proprietary \\nestates and tenures in the three States aforesaid, so as \\nto eliminate the intermediaries by means of compul-\\nsory acquisition of their rights and interests, and to \\nbring the raiyats and other occupants of lands in those \\nareas into direct relation with the Government. The \\nconstitutionality of these Acts having been challenged \\nin the respective State High Courts on nrious grounds, \\nthe Bihar Act was declared unconstitutional and void \\non the ground that it contravened article 14 of the \\nConstitution, the other grounds of attack being reject-\\ned while the other two Acts were adjudged constitu-\\ntional and valid. The appeals are directed against \\nthese decisions. Petitions have also been filed in this \\nCourt under article 32 by certain other zamindars \\nseeking determination of the same issues. The common \\nquestion which arises for consideration in all these \\nappeals and petitions is whether the three State Legis-\\nlatures, whch respetively passed the three impugned \\nstatutes, were constitutiona\\\\.ly competent to enact \\nthem, though some special points are also involved in \\na few of these cases. \\nAs has been stated, various grounds of attack \\nwere put forward in the courts below, and, all of \\nthem having been repeated in the memoranda \\nof appeals and the petitions, they would have requir-\\ned consideration but for the amendment of the \\nConstitution by the Constitution (First Amendment) \\nAct, 1951 (hereinafter referred to as the Amendment \\nAct) which was passed by the provisional Parlia- .._. \\nment during the pendency of these proceedings. \\nThat Act by inserting the new articles 31-A and -.. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 893 \\n31-B purported to protect, generally, all laws provid-\\ning for the acquisition of estates or interes.ts therein, \\nand specifically, certain statutes, including the three \\nimpugned Acts, from attacks based on article 13 read \\nwith other relevant articles of Part III of the Consti-\\ntution. And the operation of these articles was made \\nretrospective by providing, in section 4 of the Amend-\\nment Act, that article 31-A shall be \"deemed always \\nto have been inserted\" and, in article • 31-B, that \\nnone of the specified\\' statutes \"shall be deemed ever \\nto have become void\". The validity of the Amend-\\nment Act was in turn challenged in proceedings insti-\\ntuted in this Court under article 32 but was upheld \\nin Sankari Prasad Singh Dea v. Union of India and \\nState of Bihar(1). The result is that the impugned \\nActs can no longer be attacked on the ground of alleg-\\ned infringement of any of the rights conferred by the \\nprovisions of Part III. \\nIt will be noted, however, that articles 31-A and \\n31-B afford only limited protection against one ground \\nof challenge, namely that the law in question is \"in-\\nconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the \\nrights conferred by any provisions of this Part\". This \\nis made further clear by the opening words of article \\n31-A \"notwithstanding anything in the foregoing pro-\\nvisions of this Part\". The Amendment Act thus pro-\\nvides no immunity from attacks based on the lack of \\nlegislative competence under article 246, read with the \\nentries in List II or List III of the Seventh Schedule to \\nthe Constitution to enact the three impugned statutes, \\nas the Amendment Act d!d not in any way affect the \\nLists. Mr. P. R Das, leading counsel for the zamin-\\ndars, accordingly based his main argument in these \\nproceedings on entry 36 of List II and entry 42 of \\nList III which read as follows : \\n\"36. Acquisition or requisitioning \\nexcept for the purposes of the Union, \\nProvisions of entry 42 of List III. of property, \\nsubject to the \\n42. Principles on which compensation for property \\nacquired or requisitioned for the purposes of the Union \\n(1) [1952] S.C.R. 89. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga . \\nand Others ...... \\nPatanjali \\nSastri C. /. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaj a. \\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nPatanja/i \\nSastri C. /, 896 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\nor of a State or for any other public purpose is to be \\ndetermined, and the form and the manner . in which \\nsuch compensation is to be given\". \\nThe argument may be summarised thus. Entry 36 \\nof List II read with article 246(3) was obviously in-\\ntended to authorise a State Legislature to exercise the \\nright of eminent domain, that is, the right of compul-\\nsory acquisition of private property, The exercise of \\nsuch power has been recognised in· the jurisprudence of \\nall civilised countries as conditioned by public neces-\\nsity and payment of compensation. All legislation in \\nthis country authorising such acquisition of property \\nfrom Regulation I of 1824 of the Bengal Code down \\nto the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, proceeded on that \\nfooting. The existence of a public purpose and an \\nobligation to pay compensation being thus the neces-\\nsary concomitants of compulsory acquisition of private \\nproperty, the term \"acquisition\" must be construed \\nas importing, by necessary implication, the two condi-\\ntions aforesaid. It is a recognised rule for the con-\\nstruction of statutes that, unless the words of the \\nstatute clearly so demand, a statute is not to be con-\\nstrued · so as to take away the property of a subject \\nwithout compensation : Attorney-General v. De \\nKeyser\\'s Royal Hotel(1). The power to take compulsorily \\nraises by implication a right to payment ; Central \\nControl Board v. Cannon Brewery(\\'). The words \"sub-\\nject to the provisions of entry 42 of List III\" in entry 36 \\nreinforce the argument, as these words must be taken \\nto mean that the power to make a law with respect to \\nacquisition of property should be exercised subject to \\nthe condition that such law should also provide for \\nthe matters referred to in entry 4 2, in other words, a \\ntwo-fold restriction as to public purpose and payment \\n. of compensation (both of which are referred to in \\n·entry 42) is imposed on the exercise of the law mak-\\ning power under entry 36. In any case, the legisla-\\ntive power conferred under entry 42 is a power coupl-\\ned with a duty to exercise it for the benefit of the \\nowners whose properties are compulsorily acquired \\n(1) [1920) A.C. 508, 542. (2) [1919] A.C. 744. • \\n-\\n• \\n\\'· .. • \\n.. :S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 8<J7 \\n;under a law made under entry 36. For all these \\nreasons the State Legislatures, it was claimed, had no \\npower to make a law for acquisition of property with-\\nout fulfilling the two conditions as to public purpose \\n.and payment of compensation. \\nOn the basis of these arguments, counsel proceeded \\nto examine elaborately various provisions of the im-\\npugned Acts with a view to show that the compensation \\nwhich they purport to provide has, by \"various shifts \\n:and contrivances\", been reduced to an illusory figure \\nas compared with the market value of the properties \\nacquired. The principles laid down for the com-\\nputation of compensation operated m reality as \\n·\"principles of confiscation\", and the enactment \\nof the statutes was in truth a \"fraud on the Constitu-\\ntion\", each of them being a colourable legislative \\n.expedient for taking private properties , without pay-\\nment of compensation in violation of the Constitution, \\nwhile pretending to comply with its requirements. \\nNor were, these statutes enacted for any public pur~ \\npose ; their only purpose and effect was to destroy the \\ndass of zamindars and tenure-holders and make the \\nGovernment a \"super-landlord\". While such an aim \\nmight commend itself as a proper policy to be pur-\\nsued by the politkal party in power, it could not, in \\nlaw, be regarded as a public purpose. \\nMr. Somayya, who appeared for some of the zamin-\\n-dars in the Madhya Pradesh group of cases, while \\nadopting the arguments of Mr. Das, put forward an \\nadditional ground of objection. He argued that the \\nimpugned Acts were not passed in accordance with \\nthe procedure prescribed in article 31 (3) which \\n·provides \\n\"No such law as is referred to in clause (2) made \\n:by the Legislature of a State shall have effect unless \\nsuch law, having been reserved for the consideration \\nof the President, has received his assent\". \\nLearned counsel stressed the words \"law\" and \\n·•\\'legislature\" and submitted that, inasmuch as the \\nlegislature of a State included the Governor (article \\n116 .{ ·-:-. \\n1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv • \\nMaharaia\\xad\\ndhirajaSir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand O.t!zers. \\nPatanjali \\nSastri C. /. \\n• 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\ny, \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhirajaSir \\nKameshwar \\nSinKh \\nof Darbhanga \\n11nd Ot7ters. \\nPatanjali \\nSastri C. f, \\n• 898 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952J \\n168) and a bill could become a law only after the \\nGovernor assented to it under article 200, clause (3) of \\narticle 31 must be taken to require that a State law \\nauthorising compulsory acquisition of property should \\nrei;eive the Governor\\'s as well as the President\\'s \\nassent, the former to mab: it a law and the latter to \\ngive it \"effect\". As the relative bilbi were reserved \\nin each case by the Governor concerned after they \\nwere passed by the House or Houses of Legislature, a& \\n. the ::.;;,; may b~ without giving his assent under \\narticle 200, the statutes did not satisfy the require-, \\nments of article 31 (3) and so could not have \"effect\". · \\nThis ground of attack, it was claimed, was not exclud-\\n\\'ed by article 31-A or article 31-B as it was not based \\non infringement of fundamental rights. \\nDr. Ambedkar, who appeared for some of the zemin-\\ndars in the Uttar Pradesh batch of cases, advanced a· \\ndifferent line of argument. He· placed no reliance upon \\nentry 36 of List II or entry 42 of List III. He appear-\\ned to concede what Mr. Das so strenuously contested, \\nthat those entries, concerned as they were with the \\ngrant of power to the State Legislature to legislate \\nwith respect to matters specified therein, could not be \\ntaken, as a matter of construction, to import an obli--\\ngation to pay compensation. But he maintained that \\na constitutional prohibition against compulsory acqui-\\nsition of property without public necessity and pay-\\nment of compensation was deducible from what he-\\ncalled the \"spirit of the Constitution\", which, accord-\\ning to him, was a valid test for judging the constitutio-\\nnality of a statute. The Constitution, being avowedly \\n•one for establishing liberty, justice and equality and\\' \\na government of a free people with only limited powers, \\nmust be held to contain an implied prohibition against \\ntaking private · property without just compensation· \\nand in the absence of a public purpose. He relied on· \\ncertain· American decisions. and text books as support-\\ning the view that a constitutional prohibition can be \\nderived by implication from the spirit of the Con-· \\nstitution where no expr~s prohib~tion has been \\nenacted in that behalf.

The fact of the matter is the zemin-\\ndars lost the battle in the last round when this Court \\nupheld the constitutionality of the Amendment Act \\nwhich the Provisional Parliament enacted with the \\nobject, among others, of putting an end to this \\nlitigation.

Again, article 31 ( 4) excludes attack \\nonly on the ground of contravention of article 31 (2), \\nwhile article 31-A bars objections based on contraven-\\ntion of other provisions of Part III as well, such as \\narticles 14 and 19. This indeed was the reason for \\nthe enactment of articles 31-A and 31-B, as the words \\nof exclusion in article 31(4) were found inapt to cover \\nobjections based on contravention of article 14. On \\nthe other hand, the law referred to m article 31(4) \\ncovers acquisition of any kind of property, while \\n., article 31-A relates only to the acquisition of a parti-\\ncular kind of property, viz., estates and rights there-\\nin, and what is more important for our present \\npurpose, the non obstante clause in article 31 ( 4) over-\\nrides all other provisions in the Constitution including \\nthe List of the Seventh Schedule, whereas a law which \\nfalls within the purview of article 31-A could only \\nprevail over \"the foregoing provisions of this Part\". \\nNow, the three impugned statues fall within the \\n\" ambit of both article 31 ( 4) and articles 31-A and 31-B. \\nPutting aside the later articles for the moment, it is \\nplain that, under article 31 ( 4), the three impugned \\nstatutes are protected from attack in any court on the \\n• ground that they contravene the provisions of article \\n31(2). These provisions, so far as they are material \\nhere, ~ ·e (i) that a law with respect to acquisition of \\n• property ~hould authorize acquisition only for a \\n...., public purpose and (ii) that such law should provide \\nfor compensation, etc. Mr. Das, while admitting that 1952 \\nThe State of \\nHihar \\nv. \\nMahRraja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nPatanjali \\nSastri C. /. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaia· \\ndhiraia Sir \\nKameshwar1 \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nPalllniali \\nSastri C. /. 902 SU:llREME COURT REPORTS [19521 \\n(ii) was a \"provisi9n\" of article 31(2), submitted that \\n( i) was not. According to him clause (2) assumed \\nbut did not \"provide\" that acqms1t10n should be \\nauthorised only for a public purpose. I cannot accept \\nthat view. In my opinion, the clause seeks also to \\nimpose a limitation in regard to public purpose. The \\nclause was evidently worded in that form as it was \\ncopied (with minor variations) from section 299 (2) of \\nthe Govesrnment of India Act, 1935, which was un-\\ndoubetedly designed to give effect to the recommenda-\\ntion of the Joint Parliamentary Committee in para. 369 \\nof their Report that two conditions should be imposed \\non expropriation of private property : \"We think \\nit (the provision proposed) should secure that legisla-\\ntion expropriating or authorising the expropriation of \\nthe property of private individuals should be lawful \\nonly if confined to expropriation for public purpose \\nand if compernation, is determined either in the first \\ninstance or in appeal by some independent authority\". \\nIt is thus clear that section 299(2) was intended to \\nsecure fulfilment of two conditions subject to which \\nalone legislation authorising expropriation of private \\nproperty should be lawful, and it seems reasonable to \\nconclude th_at article 31 (2) was also intended to \\nimpose the same two conditions on legislation ex-\\npropriating private property. In other words, \\narticle 31 (2) must be understood as also providing \\nthat legislation authorising expropriation of private \\nproperty should be lawful only if it was required for \\na public purpose and provision was made for pay-\\nment of compensation. Indeed if this were not so, \\nthere would be nothing in the Constitution to prevent \\nacquisition for a non-public or private purpose and \\nwithout payment of compensation-an absurd result. -\\n• It cannot be supposed that the framers of the \\nConstitution, while expressly enacting one of the \\ntwo well-established restrictions on the exercise of \\nthe right of eminent domain, left the other to be \\nimported from the common law. Article 31 (2) \\nmust therefore, be taken to provide for both the \\nlimitations in express terms. An attack on the ,... .. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 903 \\nground of contravention of tliese provlSlons im-\\nplies that the law m question authorises acquisition \\nwithout reference to a public purpose and without \\npayment of compensation. This was precisely the \\nobjection raised both by Mr. Das and Dr. Ambedkar \\nto the constitutional validity of the impugned statutes, \\nand such objection really amounts to calling those \\nlaws in question on the ground that they contravened \\nthe provisions of article 31 (2), though learned counsel \\nstoutly denied that they were relying on the provi-\\nsions of article 31(2). The denial, however, seems to \\nme to be based on a quibbling distinction without a \\ndifference in substance. Their main attack was really \\ngrounded on the absence of these two essential .. ~re\\xad\\nrequisites of valid legislation authorising acqms1t1on \\nof private property, though Mr. Das would deduce \\nthem by implication from entry 36 of List II and \\nentry 42 of List III, while Dr. Ambedkar sought to \\nderive them from the spirit of the Constitution. But \\nthis is only a form of stating the objection which, in \\nsubstance, is that the statutes are bad because of the \\nabsence of a public purpose and the omission to pro-\\nvide for a just compensation. This, in fact, was the \\nburden of the argument before us. If, then, these two \\ngrounds of attack fall within the purview of article \\n31 ( 4), the words \"notwithstanding anything m this \\nConstitution\" are apt to exclude such grounds how-\\nsoever they are derived-whether from the entries in \\nthe legislative Lists or from the spirit of the Constitu-\\ntion-for both alike are covered by those words. \\nIndeed, if the objection based on the absence of a \\npublic purpose and of a provision for just compensa-\\ntion were still to be open, clause ( 4) of article 31 would -\\nbe meaningless surplusage. It is obvious that that \\nclause was specially designed to protect the impugned \\nstatutes and other laws similarly enacted from attack \\nin a court of law on the aforesaid grounds and, if they \\nwere nevertheless to be considered as not being within \\nthe protection, it is difficult to see what the use of \\narticle 31 ( 4) would be.

As po!nted out already, article 31-A \\noperates as an except10n to article 31 (2) read with \\narticle 13, only in respect of laws authorising ac-\\nquisition of \"estates\" and rights thdein, and \\nthis exception is to be deemed to have been part of \\nthe Constitution from its commencement. But it has \\nno application to laws authorising acquisition of other \\nkinds of property and, as regards these, the require-\\nments as to public purpose and payment of compen-\\nsation are still enforced by the express provisions of \\narticle 31(2). In the face of the limitations on the \\nState\\'s power of compulsory acquisition t\\'hus incor-\\nporated in the body of the Constitution, from which \\n\"estates\" alone are excluded, it would, in my opinion, \\nbe contrary to elementary canons of statutory con-\\nstruction to read, by implication, those very limita-\\ntions into entry 36 of List II, alone or in conjunction \\nwith entry 42 of list III of the Seventh Schedule, or to \\ndeduce them from \"the spirit of the Constitution\", \\nand that, c too, in respect of the very properties \\nexcluded. \\nIt is true that under the common law of eminent \\ndomain as recognised in the jurisprudence of all civi-\\nlized countries, the State cannot take the property of \\nits subject unless such property is required for a public \\npurpose and without compensating the owner for its \\nloss. But, when these limitations are expressly pro-\\nvided for and it is further enacted that no law shall \\nbe made which takes away or abridges these safe-\\nguards, and any such law, if made, shall be void, \\nthere can be no room for implication, and the words \\n\"acquisition of property\" must be understood in their \\nnatural sense of the act of acquiring property, without \\nimporting into the phrase an obligation to pay ) \\n..

The entries in the Lists of the \\nSeventh Schedule are designed to define and delimit \\nthe respective areas of legislative competence of the \\nUnion and State Legislatures, and such context is \\nhardly appropriate for the imposition of implied res-\\ntriictions on the exercise of legislative powers, which \\nare ordinarily matters for positive enactment in the \\nbody of the Constitution. \\nThere are indications in article 31 itself to show \\nthat the expression \"acquisition of property in \\nentry 36 of list II does not in itself carry any obli-\\ngation to pay compensation. Clause (4) of that \\narticle postulates a \"law\" authorising acquisition \\nof property but contravening the provisions of \\nclause (2), that is, without a public purpose or pay-\\nment of compensation. Similarly, clall!se (5) (b ), which \\nexcepts certain categories of \"laws\" from the opera-\\ntion of clause (2), contemplates· laws being made with-\\nout a public purpose or payment of compensation. \\nSuch laws can be made by a State Legislature only \\nunder entry 36 which must, therefore, be taken to \\nconfer a legislative power unfettered by any implied \\nrestrictions. ~t was suggested that the laws referred \\nto in sub-clause (b) of clause (5) are laws made in \\nexercise of the taxing power or the police power of \\nthe State as the case may be, and that the sub-clause \\nwas inserted only by way of abundant caution. This \\nis hardly a .satisfactory answer. Whatever may .be the \\nposition as to a taxing law, in regard to the source of \\nlegislative power, laws. under heads (2) and (3) of sub-\\nclause (b) must necessarily be referable to, and derive \\ntheir competence from the legislative power under \\nentry 36 of List II, in so far as they purport to autho-\\nrise acquisition of any property, for the police power \\nof the State is only the general power to regulate and \\ncontrol the exercise of private rights and lioerties in \\nthe interests of the community and does not represent \\nany specific head of legislative power.

It was said that the words \"subject to the \\nprovisions of entry 42 in List III\" must be taken to \\nmean that the law-making power under entry 36 \\ncould only be exercised subject to the two conditions \\nas to public purpose and payment of compensation, \\nboth of which are referred to in entry. 42. Those \\nwords, in my opinion, mean no more than that any \\nlaw made under entry 36 by a State Legislature can \\nbe displaced or overridden by the Union Legislature \\nmaking a law under entry 42 of List III. Tha.t they \\ncannot bear the interpretation sought to • be put upon \\nthem by Mr. Das is clear from the fact that similar \\nwords do not occur in entry 33 of List I which confers \\non Parliament the power of making laws with respect \\nto acquisition or requisitioning of property for the \\npurposes of the Union. For if the restrictive condi-\\ntions as to public purpose and pay_ment of compensa• \\ntion are to be derived only from those words, then it \\nmust follow that in the absence of those words in \\nentry 33, Parliament can make laws authorising \\nacquisition or requisitioning of property without a \\npublic purpose and a provision for compensation. No \\nreason was suggested why parliamentary legislation \\nwith respect to acquisition or requisitioning of \\nproperty is to be free from such restrictive conC!i-\\ntions while State legislation should be subject to them. \\nThe fact is that the law-making power of both Parlia-\\nment and State Legislatures can be exercised only \\nsubject to the aforesaid two restrictions, not by reason \\nof anything contained in the entries themselves, but \\nby reason of the positive provisions of article 31 (2), \\nand, as laws falling under article 31 ( 4) or under \\narticles 31-A and 31-B cannot be called in question \\nin a court of law for non-compliance with those pre>-\\nvisions, such laws cannot be struck down as uncon-\\nstitutional and void. \\nIt was further contended that the power to make a \\nlaw under entry 42 of List III was a power coupled \\nwith a duty, because such law was obviously intended ; .. > S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 907 \\nfor the benefit of the expropriated owners, and where \\nthe Legislature has authorised such expropriation, it \\nwas also bound to exercise the power of making a law \\nlaying down the principles on which such owners \\nshould be compensated for their loss. Reliance was \\nplaced in support of this somewhat novel contention on \\nthe well-known case of Julius v. Bishop of Oxford.(1) \\nThat case, however, has no application here. While \\ncertain powers may be granted in order to be exer-\\ncised in favour of certain persons who are intended to \\nbe benefited by their exercise, and on that account \\nmay well be regarded as coupled with a duty to exer-\\ncise them when an appropriate occasion for their \\nexercise arises, the power granted to a legislature to \\nmake a law with respect to any matter cannot be \\nbrought under that category. It cannot possibly have \\nbeen intended that the legislature should be under an \\nobligation to make a law in exercise of that power, for \\nno obligation of that kind can be enforced by the court \\nagainst a legislative body. \\nMr. Somayya\\'s argument based -on clause (3) \\nof article 31, to which reference has been made \\nearlier, is equally untenable. It is true that the \\n\"Legislature\" of a State includes the Governor \\nand that a bill passed by such Legislature \\ncannot become a law until it receives the Gover-\\nnor\\'s assent. Article 200, however, contemplates one \\nof three courses being adopted by the Governor when \\na bill is presented to him after it is passed by the \\nHouse or Houses of Legislature : (1) to give his assent, \\nor (2) to withhold as1sent, or (3) to reserve the bill for \\nthe consideration of the President. The first proviso, \\nto that article deals with a situation where the Gover-\\nnor is bound to give his !lssent and has no relevance \\nhere. The second proviso makes reservation compul-\\n\\'Sory where the bill would, \"if it became law\", derogate \\nfrom the powers of the High Court, but such reserva-\\ntion, it is important to note, should be made without \\nthe Governor himself giving his assent to the bill. It \\nis significant that the article does not contemplate the \\n(1) L.R. 5 H.L. 214. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaia\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof /)arbhanga \\nand Others. \\nPatanjali \\nSastri C. /. 1952. \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaia· \\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nPatanjali \\nSastri C. /. 908 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [19521 \\nGovernor giving his assent and thereafter, when the \\nbill has become a full-fledged law, reserving it for the \\nconsideration of the President. Indeed, the Governor \\nis prohibited from giving his assent where such reser-\\nvation by him is made compulsory. The Constitu-\\ntion would thus seem to contemplate only \"bills\" \\npassed by the House or Houses of Legislature being \\nreserved for the consideration of the President and not \\n\"laws\" to which the Governor has already given his \\nassent. It was said that article 31 (3) provides a \\nspecial safeguard which, in order to ensure that ne> \\nhasty or unjust expropriatory legislation is passed by \\na State Legislature, requires for such legislation the \\nassent of both the Governor and the President, and, to \\nmake this clear, the words \"law\" and \"legislature\" \\nwere deliberately used in clause (3). I am unable to \\nagree with this view. The term \"legislature\" is not \\nalways used in the Constitution as including the \\nGovernor, though article 168 mak.es him a component \\npart of the State Legislature. In article 173, for \\ninstance, the word is clearly used in the sense of the \\n\"Houses of legislature\" and excludes the Governor. \\nThere are other provisions also where the word is used \\nin contexts which exclude the Governor. Similarly \\nthe word \"law\" is sometimes loosely used in referring \\nto a bill. Article 31 (4), for instance, speaks of a \"bill\" \\nbeing reserved for the President\\'s assent \"after it has \\nbeen passed\" by the \"legislature of a State\" and of \\n\"the law so assented to.\" If the expression \"passed \\nby the legislature\" were taken to mean \"passed \\nby the Houses of the legislature and assented to \\nby the Governor\" as Mr. Somayya would have \\nit understood, then, it would cease to be a \"bill\" \\nand could no longer be reserved as such. Nor is the \\nphrase \"law so assented to,\\' strictly accurate, as the \\nprevious portion of the clause makes it clear that \\nwhat is reserved for the President\\'s assent and what \\nhe assents to is a \"bill\" and not a law. The phrase \\nobviouslv refers to what has become a law after recei-\\nving the assent of the President. Similarly, \\narticle 31(3) must, in my judgment, be understood as -S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 909 \\nhaving reference to what, in historical sequence, \\nhaving been passed by the House or Houses of the \\nState Legislature and reserved by the Governor for the \\nconsideration of the President and assented to by the \\nlatter, has thus become a h1w. If it was intended that \\nsuch a law should have the assent of both the Governor \\nand the President, one would expect to find not only \\na more clear or explicit provision to that effect, but \\nalso some reference in article 200 to the Governor\\'s \\n·power to reserve a measure for the consideration of the \\nPresident after himself assenting to it. On the other \\nhand, as we have seen, where reservation by the \\nGovernor is made obligatory, he is prohibited from \\ngiving his assent. \\n) In the view I have expressed above that the objec-\\ntions based on the lack of a public purpose and the \\nfailure to provide for payment of just compensation \\nare barred under article 31(4) and are also devoid of \\nof merits, it becomes unnecessary to consider what is \\na public purpose and whether the acquisition autho-\\nrised by the impugned statutes subserves any public \\npurpose. Nor is it necessary to examine whether the \\nscheme of compensation provided for by the statutes \\nis so illusory as to leave the expropriated owners \\nwithout any real compensation for loss of their \\n.. property. \\n.. Turning now to the special points ansmg in parti-\\ncular cases, it was urged by Mr. Das that section 4(b) \\nof the Bihar Act, which provides that all arrears of \\nrent, royalti~ and cesses due for any period prior to \\nthe date of the vesting of the estates in Government \\n\"shall vest and be recoverable by the State\" was un-\\nconstitutional and void. In the first place, there was \\nno public purpose to be served by the acquisition of \\nsuch property. The Government evidently lacked \\nfunds for the payment of even the illusory com-\\npensation provided for in the Act, and accord-\\ningly, hit upon the device of acquiring these \\narrears on payment of only 50 per cent. of their \\nvalue as provided in section 24. Raising funds 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhang11 \\nand· Others. \\nPatanjali \\nSastri C. /. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\n<Jf Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nPatanjali \\nSastri C. /. 910 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\nfor augmenting the Treasury could not be regard-\\ned as a public purpose such as would justify expro-\\npriation of private property. Secondly, it was said that \\nthese \\'arrears\\' would represent so much money when \\nrealised, and money could not be the subject of com-\\npulsory acquisition as the obligation to pay compensa-\\ntion would practically turn such acquisition into a \\nforced loan. Nor could the payment of 50 per cent of \\nthe face value of the arrears be regarded as compensa-\\ntion for the loss of the total arrears, for refund of one \\nhalf of a sum of money taken away could never make \\ngood the loss of the balance. The argument proceeds \\non a misconception. Whatever may be the position as \\nregards the acquisition of money as such, it is not \\ncorrect to say that a law made under entry 36 of List \\nII cannot authorise acquisition of choses in action like \\narrears of rent due from the tenants which are covered \\nby the term \"property\" used in that entry and in \\narticle 31. It is equally fallacious to argue that a pay-\\nment in cash or in Government bonds of half the \\namount of such arrears leaves the zemindar without \\ncompensation for the balance. It is unrealistic to \\nassume that arrears which had remained uncollected \\nover a period of years during which the zemindar as \\nlandlord had the advantage of summary remedies and \\nother facilities for collection, represented so much \\nmoney or money\\'s worth in his hands when he was to \\ncease to he a landlord and to have no longer those \\nremedies and facilities. When allowance is made for \\ndoubtful and irrecoverable arrears and the trouble and \\nexpense involved in the collection of the rest of them \\nthe payment of 50 per cent. of the face value of the \\nentire arrears must, as it seems to me, be considered \\nreasonable and fair compensation for taking them over. \\nIndeed, the contention leaves one almost wondering \\nwhat aavantage the zemindars would gain by seeking \\nto overthrow a provision in the Act which may well \\nprove beneficial to them. However tillit may be, for \\nthe reasons already indicated, article 31(4) bars a \\nchallenge on these two grounds, and the objections to \\nsection 4(b) cannot be entertained. • S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 911 \\nAn attack was also directed against section 23 (l)(f) \\nwhich provides for a deduction on a percentage basis \\nout of the gross assets as \"cost of works of benefit to the \\nraiyats of such· estate or tenure\", in ascertaining the \\nnet assets on which compensation is to be based. It \\nwas said that there was no evidence to show that it was \\nusual for the zemindars to incur such expenditure, \\nand that the deduction was a mere contrivance to reduce \\nthe compensation payable for the acquisition of their \\nestates. The provision for such deduction was there-\\nfore a fraud on the Constitution. The argument, \\nhowever, overlooks the well-established obligation of \\nthe zemindars to maintain and repair the irrigation \\ntanks and channels in the villages comprised in their \\nestates. As the Privy Council pointed out in The \\nMadras ~ilway Co. v. Zemindar of Carvatenagaram(1), \\n\"the zemandars have no power to do away with these \\ntanks in the maintenance of which large numbers of \\npeople are interested, but are charged, under Indian \\nlaw, by reason of their tenure, with the duty of pre-\\nserving and repairing them\". These are, obviously, \\nthe works of benefit to the raiyats of the · estate, and \\ntheir cost, which the zemindars are thus under an \\nobligation to bear, is a perfectly legitimate deduction \\nin computing the net assets of the estate. If the \\nzemindars had, in the past, neglected this duty, that \\ndoes not affect the propriety of the deduction before \\ndetermining the compensation payable to them. It \\nis, therefore, idle to say that it is a mere contrivance \\nfor reducing the compensation. This apart, if, as I \\nhave endeavoured to show, payment of compensation \\nisi not a justiciable issue in the case of the impugned \\nstatutes, having regard to articles 31 ( 4), 31-A and 31-B, \\nit is not open to the court to inquire whether a deduc-\\ntion which results in reducing the compensation is un-\\nwarranted and therefore, a fraud on the Constitution. \\nLastly, Mr. Das turned his attack on section 32(2) \\nread with section 43(2) (p).

It was argued \\nthat, whik\\' the Constitution conferred power on the \\nlegislatures under entry 42 of List III to make laws \\nwith respect to the principles on which compensa-\\ntiop for property acquired was to be determined \\nand the form and the mauner m wji.ich such \\ncompensation was to be given, it was not com-\\npetent for the Bihar Legislature to delegate this essen-\\ntial legislative power to the executive government. \\nSection 43 (2) (p) being thus void and inoperative, \\nsection 32 (2) must also fall to the ground, being \\nvague and incapable by itself of being \\'given effect \\nto, <Jnd, as payment of compensation was an inextri-\\ncable part of the scheme of acquisition under the Act, \\nthe entire Act must go. I see no force in this argu-\\nment. The legislature has applied its mind to the \\nform in which compensation has to be paid and has \\nfixed the number of equal instalments in which it \\nshould be paid. It has also provided for payment \\nof interest on the compensation amount in the mean-\\ntime. The proportion in which the compensation \\ncould be paid in cash and in bonds and the intervals \\nbetween the instalments have been left to be deter-\\nmined by the executive government as tliose must \\nnecessarily depend on the financial resources of the \\nState and the availability of funds in regard to which \\nthe executive government alone can have special \\nmeans of knowledge. By no standard of permissible \\ndelegation can the vesting of such limited discretion \\nby a legislature in an administrative body be held \\nincompetent. The same remark applies to the delega-\\ntion of rule-making powers in regard to payment of \\ncompensation under the other two, Acts. \\nIt\\'was contended by Mr. Somayya that the Madhya \\nPradesh Act was not dU.ly passed as no question was \\nput by the Speaker, at the third reading of the bilf, \\' • \\n.. -S.C.R.

Rule 20 (1) reads as fol-\\nlows: \\n\"A matter requiring the decision of the Assembly \\nshall be decided by means of a question put by the \\nSpeaker on a motion made by a member\". \\nWhat appears to have happened is this. One of \\nthe Ministers moved that \"The C.

Thereupon \\nthe Speaker read the motion to· the House, and this was \\nfollowed by several speeches welcoming the measure, \\namid general acclamation in the House, as a great boon \\nto the tillers of the soil. The official report of the pro-\\nceedings prepared by the Secretary under rule 115(1), \\nhowever, did not record that the Sepaker put the \\nquestion in the usual form : \"The question is etc.\" \\nand that the motion was carried. It was argued that \\nthe official report being the only \"authentic record of \\nt11e proceedings of the Assembly\" under rule 115(2), \\nit must be taken to be conclusively established that \\nthe motion was not put to the House and carried by \\nit. There is, in my opinion no substance in the objec-\\ntion.

It will be recalled \\nthat the High Court of Patna held the Bihar Act un-\\nconstitutional as being discriminatory in providing for \\npayment of compensation, and it was to overcome \\nthat difficulty that articles 31-A and 31-B were \\ninserted in the Constitution. It was conceded by \\nthe learned ,Advocate-General of \\'Madhya Pradesh \\nthat these malguzari lands could not be · regarded \\nas estates within the meaning of article 31-A read \\nwith the Tenancy Acts in force in Madhya Pradesh, \\nbut he contended that, inasmuch as article 31-B pur-\\nported to validate specifically the Madhya Pradesh \\nAct among others, and as that article was not limited \\nin its application to estates, the objection could not \\nprevail. Mr. Somayya, however, submitted that the \\nopening words of article 31-B, namely, \"Without \\nprejudice to the generality of the provisions contained \\nin article 31-A\" showed that the mention of parti-\\ncular statutes in article 31-B read with the Ninth \\nSchedule was only illustrative, and that, accordingly, \\narticle 31-B could not be wider in scope. Reliance \\nwas placed in support of this argument upon the deci-\\nsion of the Privy Council in Sibnath Banerji\\'s case(\\'). \\nI cannot agree with that view. There is nothing in \\narticle 31-B to indicate that the specific mention of \\n(!) [1945] F.C.R. 195 (P.C.) S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 915 \\ncertain statutes was only intended to illustrate the \\napplication of the general words of article 31-A. The \\nopening words of article 31-B are only intended to \\nmake clear that article 31-A should not be restricted \\nin its application by reason of anything contained in \\narticle 31-B and are in no way calculated to restrict \\nthe application of the latter article or of the enactments \\nreferred to therein to acquisition of \" estates. \" The \\ndecision cited affords no useful analogy. \\nIn some of the cases the estates sought to be acquir-\\ned are situated in what was previously the territory of \\nIndian States and belong to their former rulers. On \\nthe merger of those States in Madhya Pradesh or \\nUttar Pradesh, as the case may be, by virtue of the \\n\"covenant of merger\" entered into between the rulers \\nand the Government of India the properties in question \\nwere recognised to be the \"private property\" of the \\nRulers. In these cases it was urged that that estates \\nsought to be acquired formed part of the Rulers\\' \"per-\\nsonal rights\" guaranteed to them under the instrument \\nof merger, and that neither the impugned statutes nor \\nthe notifications· issued thereunder could deprive the \\nRuler of such properties in contravention of article \\n362. The Attorney-General had several answers to \\nthis argument, including the bar under article 363 to \\ninterference by courts in disputes arising out of agree-\\nments, covenants, etc., by Rulers of Indian States to \\nwhich the Government of India was a party. But a \\nshort and obvious answer is that there was no \\ncontravention of any guarantee or assurance \\ngiven by the Government under the covenant of \\nmerger, as the estates in question are sought to \\nbe acquired only as the \"private property\" of \\nthe Rulers and not otherwise. The compensation \\nprovided for, such as it is, is in recognition of their \\nprivate proprietorship, as in the case of any other \\nowner. There is, therefore, no force in this objection. \\nIn Appeal No. 285 of 1951 preferred by the Raja of \\nKapurthala, where a similar objection was raised, it \\nwas further alleged that the privy purse of the Ruler \\nwas fixed at a low figure in consideration of the Oudh \\n4-10 S. c.

In the \\nabse!Jce of any material to establish the facts, the \\nallegation calls for no· consideration. \\nCertain other minor points were also raised in some \\nof the cases but they are ·not worth mentioning as \\n,they proceeded either on a misapprehension or were \\npalpably unsound. \\nThus all the objections raised to the constitutional \\nvalidity of the Bihar Act, the Madhya Pradesh Act \\nand the Uttar Pradesh Act or any part thereof fail \\nand are overruled. \\nMAHAJAN J.-This is an appeal under article 132(3) \\nof the Constitution of India from a judgment of the \\nFull Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Patna, \\ndated the 12th March, 1951, whereby the High Court \\ndeclared the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950, ultra vires \\non the ground of its infringement of article 14 of the \\nConstitution, but decided against the respondent on \\nall other points. \\nOn the 30th December, 1949, a Bill intituled the \\nBihar Land Reforms Bill was introduced in the \\nLegislative Assembly qf Bihar and was passed by \\nboth the Houses of Legislature, and after having been \\nreserved for the consideration of the President of \\nIndia, received his assent on the 11th September, 1950. \\nThe Act was published in the Bihar Government \\nGazette on the 25th September, 1950, and on the \\nsame day a ·notification under section 1 (3) of the Act \\nwas published declaring that the Act would come \\ninto force immediately. On the same day, a \\nnotification under section 3 of the Act was published \\nstating that the estates and tenures belonging to the \\nrespondent and two others passed to and became \\nvested in th~ State of Bihar under the provisions of \\nthe Act. The respondent filed a petition in the High \\nCourt of Judicature at Patna under article 226 of the \\nConstitution, challenging the constitutionality of the •• \\n• .. \\n-S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 917 \\nsaid Bihar Land Reforms Act and praying fur a writ \\nin the nature of mandamus to be issued on the State \\nof Bihar restraining it from acting in any man-\\nner by virtue of, or under the provisions of, the \\nsaid Act. This application was heard along with \\nthree title suits and other similar applications filed by \\nvarious zemindars of Bihar by a Special Bench of the \\nHigh Court. By three separate but concurring judg-\\nments, the Court declared the Act to be unconstitu-\\ntional and void on the ground of its infringement of \\nfundamental right under article 14 of the Constitution. \\nThe validity of tl1e Act was attacked before the \\nHigh Court on the following grounds : \\n1. That the Bihar Legislature had no competence \\nto pass it. \\n2. That it contravened clause (I) of article 31 of \\nthe Constitution. \\n3. That the vesting of the estates in the State of \\nBihar under the Act being in effect an acquisition of \\nthe estates, it was invalid as that acquisition was not \\nfor a public purpose and the provision for compen-\\nsation was illusory. \\n4. That it contravened article 19(1) (f) of tht\\' \\nConstit,ution. \\n5. That some of its provisions were invalid on \\nthe ground of delegation of legislative powers. \\n6. That it was a fraud on the Constitution. \\n7. That it was unconstitutional as it contravened \\narticle 14 of the Constitution. \\nThe Court held as follows :-\\n1. That the Bihar Legislature was competent to \\nenact the legislation. \\n2. That the Act did not contravene article 31(1) \\nof the Constitution. \\n3. That the acquisition of the estates and tenures \\nwas for a public purpose. \\n4. That the subject-matter of the Act fell under \\narticle 31 ( 4) of the Constitution. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMahara7a\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nI<.ameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMahajan /. • 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja· \\nJhira7a Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMahajan /. 918 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\n5. That article 19 (1) (f) had no application. \\n6. That whatever powers were delegated to the \\nexecutive were permissible. \\n7. That the Act was not a fraud on the Constitu-\\ntion. \\n8. That the Act was unconstitutional as it contra-\\nvened article 14 of the Constitution. \\nDuring the pendency of the appeal against the \\ndecision of the High Court the Union Government \\nwith a view to put an end to the litigation of the \\nzamindars brought forward a Bill to amend the \\nConstitution and this was passed by the requisite \\nmajority as the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, \\n1951. The zamindars brought petitions under article \\n32 of the Constitution impugning the Amendment \\nAct itself as unconstitutional and void. All these \\npetitions were disallowed by this Court on the 5th \\nOctober, 1951, and it was held that the Constitu-\\ntion (First Amendment) Act, 1951, had been validly \\nenacted. In view of the Amendment Act any \\nargu_ment regarding the unconstitutionality of the \\nBihar Act based on the ground that the prov1s1ons \\nof that Act contravened articles 14, 19 or 31 \\nof the Constitution does not survive and the Act is \\nnot open to challenge on any such ground. As the \\nAct has been held\\' invalid by the High Court solely on \\nthe ground that it violated the provisions of article 14 \\nof the Constitution, the basis of the judgment declaring \\nthe Act to be unconstitutional is no longer tenable \\nand it has therefore to be reversed in case this Court \\nagrees with the decision of the High Court oii the \\npoints decided against the respondent. \\nMr. P. R. Das for the respondent frankily conceded \\nthat no objection to the validity of the Act at this \\nstage could be raised on the ground that it contra-\\nvened any of the provisions of Part III of the Con-\\nstitution. He, however, supported the decision of the \\nCourt on grounds decided against him by that Court \\nand urged the following points :-; \\n-S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 919 \\n1. That it was not within the competence of the \\nBih\\'\\\\r State Legislature to enact the impugned Act. \\n2. That the acquisition of the estates not being \\nfor public purpose, the Act was unconstitutional. \\n3. That the legislative power in various sections of \\nthe Act has been abdicated in favour of the executive \\nand such abdication of power was unconstitutional. \\n4. That the Act was a fraud on the Constitution \\nand that certain parts of the Act were unenforceable on \\naccount of vagueness and indefiniteness. \\nThe foundation of Mr. P. R. Das\\'s attack on the \\nvires of the Act mainly rests on the contention that it \\nis implicit within the language of entry 36 of List II \\nof the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution that pro-\\nperty could not be acquired without payment of com-\\npensation, the only effect of a compulsory power of \\nacquisition against the individual being that there is \\nthe power to oblige him to sell and convey property \\nwhen the public necessities require it, but that the \\npower to take compulsorily raises by implication a \\nright to payment ; in other words, there is a con-\\ncomitant obligation to pay and the power to acquire \\nis inseparable from the obligation to pay compen-\\nsation and as the provisions of the statute in respect \\nof payment of compensation are illusory, it is uncon-\\nstitutional. \\nAs regards article 31 (2) of the Constitution, it is \\nsaid that it deals with the fundamental right re-\\ngarding property which is expressed in the clause in \\nnegative language. In entry 36 it is expressed in an \\naffirmative form. The provisions of articles 31(4) and \\n31-A and 31-B, though they deprive the expropriated \\nproprietor of his rights provided in Part III of the \\nConstitution, do not in any way affect the ambit of \\nentry 36 and empower the State Legislature to make \\na law for compulsory acquisition of property without \\npayment of compensation in the true sense of that term. \\nEmphasis is laid on the words \"subject to the provi-\\nsions of entry 42\" contained in entry 36 and it is \\ncontended that the exercise of legislative power under 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMahajan/. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaia\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMshajan /. 920 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\nentry 36 is conditional on exercise of power under \\nentry 42, that one could not be exercised without the \\nother and that the power conferred by the two entries \\nhad to be construed on the assumption that the acqui-\\nsitiop. was to be paid for. It is further contended that \\nthe legislative power in entry 42 is a power coupled with \\ndnty which the legislature was bound to exercise for the \\nbenefit of the person whose property was taken in exer-\\ncise of the legislative power under entry 36. It is also \\nsaid that the Bihar Legislature had legislated both \\nunder entry 36 and entry 42 and intended to take the \\nproperty conditional on payment of compensation but \\nif it transpires that the provisions it has made about \\npayment of compensation are illusory, then that part \\nof the Act would be void and as it could not have been \\nintended by the legislature to pass the Act in any \\ntruncated form in which it would remain if the provi-\\nsions regarding compensation are taken out of it, the \\nwhole Act should be held unconstitutional. \\nTo appreciate the contentions raised by Mr. Das on \\nthe question of the competence of the Bihar Legisla-\\nture to enact the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950, it is \\nnecessary to refer to its provisions and to see on what \\nsubjects the legislature has purported to enact the \\nlaw. \\nThe title of the Act indicates that the law provides \\nfor some kind of land reform in Bihar. Its preamble \\ngives no indication as to the nature of these reforms \\nexcept that it provides for the constitution of a \\nLand Commission to advise the St:ite Government on \\nthe agrarian policy, whatever that expression may \\nmean. The dominant purpose of the Act is that of \\ntransference to the State of the interests of proprietors \\nand tenure-holders in land and of the mortgagees and \\nlessees of such interests including the interests in trees, \\nforests, fisheries, jalkars, ferries, huts, bazars, mines \\nand minerals. Section 3 provides that the Government \\nmay, from time to time, by notification declare the \\nestates or tenures mentioned therein to have passed \\nand become vested in the State. Section 4 mentions \\nthe consequences of such vesting. It enacts that the • \\n• S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 921 \\ninterests of the proprietor or tenure-holder in any \\nbuilding or part of a building comprised in such estate \\nor tenure and used primarily as office or cutchery for \\nthe colletion of rent of such estate or tenure, and his \\ninterests in trees, forests, fisheries, jalkars, huts, bazars, \\nand ferries and all other sairati interests as also his \\ninterest in the subsoil including any rights in \\nmines and minerals, whether discovered or undis-\\ncovered, or whether being worked or not, inclusive \\nof such rights of lessee of mines and minerals, com-\\nprised in such estate or tenure (other than the interests \\nof raiyats or under raiyats) shall vest absolutely in \\nthe State free from all incumhrances. Clause (b) pro-\\nvides that all arrears of rents, including royalties and \\nall cesses together with interest, if any, due thereon for \\nany period prior to the date of vesting, which were re-\\ncoverable in respect of the estates or tenures of the \\nproprietor or tenure-holder and the recovery of which \\nwas\\' not barred by any law of limitation shall vest in, \\nand be recoverable by, the State. The expression \\n\"arrears of rent\" includes arrears in respect of which \\nsuits were pending on the date of vesting or in respect \\nof which decrees whether having the effect of rent \\ndecree or monev decree were obtained before the date \\nof such vesting -and had not been satisfied and were \\nnot barred by limitation and also includes the costs \\nallowed by such decrees. In other words, all outstand-\\ni11gs in the nature of rents and rent decrees that \\nwere due to the proprietors or tenure-holders before \\ntJ1e date of vesting and before the State had any right, \\n:itle or inkn.:st in the estate would also pass to it. \\n·rhis seems to be a peculiar and rather extraordinary \\nconsequence of the vesting of an estate. Normally it \\nhas no relation to and cannot be regarded as an inci-\\ndent of the transference of tlie estates. The clause \\nis m effect an independent provision laying down \\nthat monies due to the proprietor or tenure-holder \\nduring the period antecedent to the vesting and \\nnot realized by him but which were in the course of \\nrealization, whether by private effort or by means of \\npending suit~ or decree~ including the costs of those 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMahajan /. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\n<Jf Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMahajan /, 922 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\nsuits and decrees will stand forfeited to the State. \\nIn clause ( c) the liability of the proprietors or tenure-\\nholders for payment of arrears of revenue and cesses to \\nth.e Government prior to the date of vesting is kept \\nalive. The other consequences of vesting are that no \\nsuit can be maintained for recovery of any money \\nfrom a proprietor or tenure-holder which is secured by \\na mortgage or charge on the estate and no such estate \\nor tenure covered by the Act is liable to attachment. \\nThe Collector is entitled to take charge of the estate \\nand to inspect the documents and accounts which he \\nthinks necesisary to do for the management of the \\nestate or tenure. Section 5 permits the proprietors \\nand tenure-holders to retain their homesteads but \\nonly in the capacity of tenants free from the obliga-\\ntion to pay rent. Section 6 allows them to retain \\npossession of lands in their khas possession or in the \\npossession of lessees under them, on payment of rent \\nas raiyats to the State in the status of occupancy \\ntenants. Section 7 provides that buildings together \\nwith lands on which such buildings stand and in the \\npossession of proprietors and tenure-holders and used \\nas golas, factories or mills shall be retained by them \\non payment of rent. Section 8 gives a right of appeal \\nto a party aggrieved against the Collector\\'s order. In \\nsection 9 it is provided that all mines comprised in \\nthe estate or tenure as were in operation at the com-\\nmencement of this Act and were being worked directly \\nby the proprietor or· tenure-holder shall he deemed to \\nhave been leased by the State Government to the pro-\\nprietor or tenure-holder. This section does not include \\nwithin its scope mines on which considerable money \\nmight have been spent but which are actually not m \\noperation.

Sections 14, 15, \\n16, 17 and 18 make provisions relating to the investi-\\ngation of debts of proprietors and tenure-holders and \\nJay down the procedure for payment of those debts. \\nIn section 19 prov1SJon 1s made for the appointment \\nof compensation officer. Certain directions are given \\nin sections 20 and 21 regarding the procedure to be \\nadopted by the compensation officer when the pro-\\nprietor has only a certain share in an estate and where \\ncertain trusts have been created by the tenure-holder \\n<lr proprietor. Section 22 defines \"previous agn-\\ncultural year\" and the phrase \"gross assets\" with \\nreference to a proprietor or tenure-holder. \"Gross \\nassets\" in the Act means the aggregate of the rents \\nincluding all cesses, which were payable in respect of \\nthe estates or tenures of such proprietor or tenure-\\nholder for the prevwus agricultural vear, whether \\npayable by a subordinate tenant or · the raivats. \\nCertain details are laid down for the assessment of \\nthose rents. In the exprnss1on \"gross assets\" 1s also \\nincluded the gross mcome of the prev10us agricultural \\nyear from fisheries, trees, jalkiars, ferries, huts, bazars \\n.and sairati interests. Gross mcome from forests \\nhas to be calculated on the basis of the average gross \\nannual income of twenty-five agricultural years pre-\\nceding the agricultural year in which the date of vest-\\nmg falls, which in the opinion of a forest officer, the \\nforests would have yielded if they had been placed \\nduring the said period of twenty-five years under the \\nmanagement of the State. \\nSection 23 lays down the method of computation of \\nnet income. It provides that the net mcome of a \\nproprietor or tenure-holder shall be computed by \\ndeducting from the gross asset of such proprietor or \\ntenure-holder, as the case may be, the following :-\\n(a) any sum payable as land revenue or rent; 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\n11nd 0 thers. \\nMahajan /. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMahajan f. 924. SUPREME COURT REPORTS [19521 \\n(b) any sum payable by such proprietor as agri-\\ncultural income-tax in respect of any agricultural \\nincome derived from such estate or tenure for the \\nprevious agricultural year ; \\n( c) any sum payable by such proprietor or tenure \\nholder as income-tax in respect of any income derived \\nfrom such estate or tenure, other than royalties for the \\nprevious agricultural year ; \\n(d) any sum payable as chaukidari tax or muni-\\ncipal tax ; \\n( e) cost of management of such estate or tenure \\nat rates varying from five to twenty per cent. accord-\\ning to the amount of the gross asset The lowest \\nlimit fixed is at Rs. 2,000, and the highest at any \\namount exceeding Rs. 15,000. \\nThese rates appear to have been fixed in an arbitrary \\nmanner bearing no relation whatsoeyer to the actual \\ncost of management. To illustrate, in the case of the \\nMaharaja of Darhhanga whose estate has a gross \\nincome of nearly forty-eight lakhs, the cost of manage-\\nment, according to this calculation, would work out \\nto a sum of nine an<l a half lakhs, which on the face of \\nit looks starting; it can hardly have any relation \\nto the costs actually incurred. The expense ratio \\nunder the head \"management would ordinarily be \\nlowest for the higheH gross income. It goes up m \\nproportion to the reduction in the amount of gross \\nincome. The Act has, however, reversed this rule of \\neconomics with the result that part of the money that \\non the principles stated for determining compensation \\nwould be payable by way of compensation to the \\nproprietor or tenure-holder stands forfeite<l by this \\nartificial reduction .of the net income. Clause (f) \\nprovides for deduction from the gross assets of cost of \\nworks of benefit to the raiyats of such est2tes or tenures \\nat rates varying from four to twelve and a haif per \\ncent., the rate of four per cent. being applicable \\nwhere the gross asset doos not exceed Rs. 5,000, and \\nthe rate of twelve and a half per cent. being applicable \\nif the gross asset exceeds Rs. 25,000. It is obvious \\' \\n\\' \\n. -\\' -\\n-S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 925 \\nthat the calculation of the cost of works of benefit \\nto the raiyats at a flat rate without any reference \\nto the actual expenses that might have been incurred \\nis a provision of a confiscatory character. It arti-\\nficially reduces the net income which is the basis \\nof the assessment of compensation. The last clause (g) \\nof this section allows deduction of any other tax or \\nlegal imposition, payable in respect of such estate or \\ntenure not expressly mentioned in the earlier clauses. \\nSection 24 provides the manner of determination of \\nthe compensation payable to the proprietor or tenure-\\nholder. It lays down a sliding scale for the assessment \\nof compensation. Where the net income does not \\nexceed Rs. 500, the compensation payable is twenty \\ntimes the net income and where the net income com-\\nputed exceeds Rs. 1,00,000, it is payable at three times \\nthe amount. The compensation in such cases is merely \\nnominal. In the case of the Maharaja of Darbhanga, \\nthe estate acquired also comprised land purchased by \\nhim by spending about a crore of rupees and also com-\\npri.<Jed mortgages, to the tune of half a crore. All these \\nvest in the Bihar State along with the inherited \\nzemindari~ of the Maharaja and arrears of rent \\namounting to Rs. 30,00,000, while the total compen-\\nsation payable is ne:1rly a sum of Rs. 9,00,000. This \\nsection further provides that to the amount thus \\npayable shall be added the amount of fifty per cent. \\nof ~he arrears of rent referred to in clause (b) of sec-\\ntion 4 along with the amount of rnmpensation paya-\\nble in respect of mines and minerals as determined \\nunder section 25. The section also lays down the \\nmethod of assessment of compensation in the case of \\npersons who have only a share in the zamindari or have \\nother minor interests in the tenures or estates where \\ni-he estate or tenure is held in the trust etc., or where they \\nare of an impartible nature. In the case of mines and \\nminerals the method of assessment is laid down in \\nsection 25. It has either to be fixed by agreement or \\nby a tribunal appointed for the purpose. The subse-\\nquent section~; provide for the preparation of compen-\\nsation roll and for hearing of appeals etc. Section 32 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMahajan/. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\n<Jf Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMahajan /. 926 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\nlays down the method and manner of p~yment of \\ncompensation. Sub-section (2) of this section enacts \\nthat the amount of compensation shall be paid in cash \\nor in bonds or part! y in cash and partly in bonds. \\nThe bonds shall be eitl-ier negotiable or non-negotiable \\nand non-transferable and be payable in forty equal \\ninstalmen~s to the perrnn named therein and shall \\ncarry interest at two and a half per cent. per annum \\nwith effect from the date of issue. Any disputes about \\ncompensation between the proprietors or tenure \\nholders have to be determined by a tribunal appointed \\nby the State Government. Section 34 provides for \\nthe constitution of a commission called the Bihar \\nLand Commission. The other provisions of the Act \\nare of a miscellaneous character and require no special \\nmention. The last section authorizes the State \\nGovernment to make rules for carrying out the pro-\\nvisions of the Act. \\nFrom this survey of the Act it appears that the \\nlaw enacted might be taken to relate to several items \\nin the legislative lists, i.e., rights in or over land and \\nland tenures, forests, fisheries, mines and minerals, \\nacquisition of property and also principles on which \\ncompensation for property acquired is to be deter-\\nmined. The pith and substance of the legislation \\nhowever, in my opinion, is the transference of owner-\\nship of estates to the State Governmeru and falls \\nwithin the ambit of legislative head entry 36 of \\nL>st II. There is no scheme of land reform within \\nthe framework of the statute except that a pious hope \\nis expressed that the commission may produce one. \\nThe Bihar Legislature was certainly competent to \\nmake the law on the subject of transference of estates \\nand the Act as regards such transfers 1s con-\\nstitutional. \\nThe Act further deals with the realization of arrears \\nof rents due before the date of vesting of the estates \\nto the zemindars and forfeits fifty per cent. of such \\nrealization to the State exchequer. It also in an in-\\ndirect manner forfeits the State exchequer part of the \\ncompensation money which would have been payable .. S.C.R; SUPREME COURT REPORTS 927 \\nto the proprietors or tenureholders if the net income \\nwas not reduced by deduction from the gross income \\nof items of artificial nature which have no relation to \\nany actual expenses. Both these provlSlons will \\nbe separately dealt with hereinafter as, in my opi-\\nnion, the enactment of these provisions is uncon-\\nstitutional. \\nHaving held that the Bihar Act is constitutional as \\nregards transfer of estates to the State and that this \\nis mainly an enactment under legislative head 36 of \\nLis:t II, it is convenient now to examine the conten-\\ntion of Mr. Das to the effect that in the contents of \\nthe power conferred on the legislature by this entry \\ntheir exists a concomitant obligation to pay compen-\\nsation and that as the provisions regarding payment of \\ncompensation are illusory, the Act i:s unconstitutional \\nand that article 31 ( 4) of the Constitution does not \\nafford any protection against this attack. \\nFor a proper appreciation and appraisal of the pro-\\nposition of Mr. P. R. Das that the obligation to pay \\ncompensation is implicit in the language of entry 36 of \\nList II of the Seventh Schedule and that the power to \\ntake compulsorily raises by implication a right to \\npayment, the power to acquire being inseparable from \\nthe obligation to pay compensation, it is necessary to \\nexamine briefly the origin of the power of the State on \\nthe subject of compulsory acquisition of property. \\nThis power is a sovereign power of the State. Power \\nto take property for public use has been exercised \\nsince olden times. Kent speaks of it as an inherent \\nsovereign power. As an incident to thi,<; power of the \\nState is the requirement that property shall not be \\ntaken for public use without just compensation. Mr. \\nBroom in his work on Constitutional Law says, \"Next \\nin degree to the right of personal liberty is that of \\nenjoying private property without undue interference \\nor molestation, and the requirement that property \\nshall not be taken for public use without just compen-\\nsation is but an aflirmance of the great doctrine esta-\\nblished by the common law for the protection of pri-\\nvate property.

(1952] \\nIn the \\nBoard v. \\nto take \\nto pay-\\nOn the continent the power of compulsory acqms1-\\ntion is described by the term \"eminent domain\". This \\nterm seems to have been originated in 1625 by Hugo \\nGrotius, who wrote of this power in his work \"De Jure \\nBelli et Pacis\\'\\' as follows : \\n\"The property of subjects is under the eminent \\ndomain of the State, so that the State or he who acts \\nfor it may use and even alienate and destroy such \\nproperty, not only in the case of extreme necessity, \\nin which even private persons have a right over the \\nproperty of others, but for ends of public utility, \\nto which ends those who founded civil society must \\nbe supposed to have intended that private ends \\nshould give way. But it is to be added that when \\nthis is done the State is bound to ·make good the loss \\nto those who lose their property.\" \\nThe relationship between the individual\\'s right to \\ncompensation and the sovereign\\'s power to condemn \\nis discussed in Thayer\\'s Cases on Constitutional Law \\n(Vol. I, p. 953) (mentioned on page 3 of Nichols on \\nEminent Domain) in these words .:-\\n\"But while this obligation (to make compen-\\nsation) is thus well established and clear, let\\' it be \\nparticularly noticed upon what grounded it stands viz., \\n. upon the natural rights of the individual. On the \\notht;.r hand, the right of the State to take springs from \\na different source, viz., a necessity of government. \\nThese two, therefore, have not the same origin ; they \\ndo not come, for instance, from any implied watract \\nbetween the State and the individual, that the former \\nshall have the property, if it will make compensation ; \\nthe right is no mere right to pre-emption, and it has \\nno condition of compensation annexed to it: either \\nprecedent or subsequent ; but there is a right to take, \\n(1) [19191 A.C. 744. • .~.

The meaning of the power in its irreducible \\nterms is, (a) power to take, (b) without the owner\\'s \\nconsent, ( c) for the public use. The concept of the \\npublic use has been inextricably related to an appro-\\npriate exercise of the power and is considered essen-\\ntial in any statement of its meamng. Payment of \\ncompensation, though not an essential ingredient of \\nthe connotation of the term, is an essential element \\nof the valid exercise of such power. Courts have \\ndefined \"eminent domain\" so as to include this \\nuniversal J imitation as an essential constituent of its \\nmeaning. Authority is universal m support of the \\namplified definition of \"eminent domain\" as the \\npower of the sovereign to take property for public \\nuse without the owner\\'s consent upon making just \\ncom pensa ti on. \\nIt is clear, . therefore, that the obligation for pay-\\nment of just compensation is a necessary incident of \\nthe power of compulsory acquisition of property, \\nboth under the doctrine of the English Common Law \\nas well as under the continental doctrine of eminent \\ndomain, subsequently adopted in America. \\nThe question for consideration is whether this \\nobligation to pay compensation for compulsory \\nacquisition of property has been impliedly laid down \\nby the constitution makers in our Constitution under \\nlegislative head in entry 36 of List II and entry 33 of \\nList I, or whether this all important obligation which \\nfollows ocmpulsory acquisition as a shadow has been \\nput in express and clear terms somewhere else in the \\nConstitution. To my mind, our Constitution has \\nraised this obligation to pay compensation for the 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMahajan J, 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharafa· \\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMahajan /. 930 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952) \\n\\' \\ncompulsory acquisition of property to the status of. a \\nfundamental right and it has declared that a law \\nthat does not make provision for payment of compen-\\nsation shall be void. It did not leave the matter to \\nbe discovered and spelt out by learned arguments at \\nthe Bar from out of the contents of entry 36 ; they \\nexplicitly provided for it in article 31 (2) of the \\nConstitution. As the obligation to pay has been \\nmade a compulsory part of a statute that purports to \\nlegislate under entry 33 of List I and entry 36 of \\nList II, it is not possible to accede to the contention \\nof Mr. P. R. Das that the duty to pay compensation \\nis a thing inherent in the language of <;l).try 36. . I \\nagree with the learned Attorney-General that tlY.: \\nconcept of acquisition and that of compensation are \\ntwo different notions having their origin in different \\nsources. One is founded on the sovereign power of \\nthe State to take, the other is based on the natural \\nright of the person who is dqirived of property to be \\ncompensated for his loss. One is the power to take, \\nthe other is the condition flor the exercise of tl1at \\npower. Power to take was mentioned in entry 36, \\nwhile the condition for the exercise of· that power \\nwas embodied in article 31 (2) and there was no duty \\nto pay compensation implicit in the content of the \\nentry itself. \\nReference m this connection may be made to the \\nGovernment of India Act, 1935. By section 299 of \\nthat statute a fetter was imposed on the power of \\nlegislation itself. The Constitution, however, de-\\nclared laws not providing for compensation · as void \\nand it not only placed a fetter on the power of legis. \\nlation but it guaranteed the expropriated proprietor a \\nremedv in article 32 of the Constitution for enforce-\\nment 0of his fundamental right. I am therefore of the \\nopinion that Mr. Das is not right in his contention \\nthat unless adequate provision is made by a law en-\\nacted under legislative power conferred by entry 36 of \\nList I for compensation, the law is unconstitutional \\nas entry 36 itself does not authorize the making of \\nsuch a law without providing for compensation. Then ,, S.C.R .• SUPREME COURT REPORTS 931 \\nit was said that entry 36 of List II was linked up with \\nentry 42 of the Concurrent List by the words \"subject \\nto\" occurring therein and that the validity of any law \\nmad<\\'. in exercise of legislative power under entry 36 \\nwas conditional on the simultaneous exercise of the \\nlegislative power under entry 42 and because there \\nhas been no valid exercise of this power (the pro-\\nvisions of the impugned Act regarding the determina-\\ntion of compensation being illusory), the legislation \\nunder entry 36 fails. In my opinion, this contention \\nis unsound. The two entries referred to above are \\nmerely heads of legislation and are neither inter-\\ndependent nor complementary to one another. It is \\nby force of the provisions of article 31 (2) that it be-\\ncomes obligatory to legislate providing for compen-\\nsation under entry 42 of the Concurrent List in order \\nto give validity to a law enacted under entry 36 and \\nnot by reason of the use of the words \"subject to\" in \\nthe wording of the entry. No such words occur in \\nentry 33 of the Union List. It cannot reasonably be \\nargued that Parliament could make a law for com-\\npulsory acquisition of property for hs purposes with-\\nout fulfilling the condition of making a law under \\nentry 42 of the Concurrent List, but a State Legis-\\nlature in this respect is in a different situation. Such \\na contention, in my opinion, is untenable. The only \\npurpose of the words \"subject to\" occuring in \\nentry 36 is to indicate that legislation under entry 36 \\nwould be subject to any law made by Parliament in \\nexercise of its legislative power under entry 42 of the \\nConcurrent List. Both legislatures can legislate under \\nentry 42 but the Parliamentary statute made in \\nexercise of powers under this entry would have pre-\\nference over a State law in case of repugnancy and it \\nwas for this reason that reference was made to entry 42 \\nin the head of legislation mentioned in the State List \\nunder entry 36. In other words, it only means that \\nwhenever a law is made by a State Legislature in exer-\\ncise of its legislative power under entry 36, that law \\nwill be subject to the provisions of a Parliamentary \\nstatute made in exercise of its legislative powers \\nunder entry 42 of the C\\'nncurrent List. \\n5-10 S.

Reference was made in \\nthis connection to the observations of Lord Cairns in \\nJulius v. Bishop of Oxford(1). The principle of that \\ndecision is that where power is conferred in the nature \\nof a trust there is an obligation to exercise it for the \\nbenefit of the cestui que trust. These o.bservations do \\nnot have any apposite application to the case of legis-\\nlative powers conferred by a constitution. The \\nentries in the lists are merely legislative heads and \\nare of an enabling character. Duty to exercise legis-\\nlative power and in a particular manner cannot be \\nread ·into a mere head of legislation. If the argument \\nof the learned counsel was sound, then it would be \\nopen to this Court to issue a mandamus to the legis-\\nlature to exercise its power of legislation under \\nentry 42, if it failed to do so. Mr. Das, when faced \\nwith this question, had to admit that he could not \\nseriously contend that a legislature could be directed \\nto enact a statute if it did not wish to do so. Failure \\nto make a law under entrv 42 cannot make a law \\nmade under entry 36 bad. Ii1 my opinion, the decision \\nin the case of Julms v.

Article 31(4) is in these terms:-\\n\"If any Bill pending at the commencement of \\nthis Constitution in the legislature of a State has, \\nafter it has been passed by such Legislature, been \\n(1) (1880) 5 App. Cas. 214. \\' \\n.~ S.C.R.

A \\nstrict construction has to be placed on the language of \\nthis clause, it being in the nature of a debarring pro-\\nvision. In my opinion, the provisions of sub-clause \\n(2) made unjusticiable by clause (4), relate to the \\ndetermination and payment of compensation. The \\nwhole purpose of the clause is to make the obligation \\nto pay compensation a condition precedent to the \\ncompulsory acquisition of property. The words of \\nthe clause preceding the word \"unless\" are merely \\ndescriptive of the law, the validity of which would be \\nquestionable if there was no provision for determina-\\ntion and for payment of compensation for the property \\ntaken in its contents. The use of the word \"such\" \\nfully supports this interpretation. The mandate of \\nthe clause is that such a law must contain a provision \\nfor payment of compensation to the expropriated \\nproprietor. According to the Oxford Dictionary, \\n(Vol. 8, p. 1526) the expression \"Provision\" when \\nused in statutes, has reference to what is expressly \\nprovided therein. What article 31 ( 4) really \\nsays is that the contravention of the express \\nprovisions of article 31 (2) relating to payment of \\ncompensation will not be a justiciable issue. It has \\nno reference to anything that may be implied within \\nthe language of that clause. The existence of a \"public \\npurpose\" is undoubtedly an implied condition of the \\nexercise of compulsory powers of acquisition by the \\nState, but the language of article 31(2) does A not .. \\nJ \\n.. ~ -. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 935 \\nexpressly make it a condition precedent to acquisition. \\nIt assumes that compulsory acquisition can be for a \\n\"public purpose\" only, which is thus inherent in such \\nacquisition. Hence article 31(4), in my opinion, does \\nnot bar the jurisdiction of the court from inquiring \\nwhether the law relating to compulsory acquisition of \\nproperty is not valid because the acquisition is not \\nbeing made for a public purpose. This is also the view \\ntaken by the learned Judges of the Patna High Court. \\nThe sovereign power to acquire property compulsorily \\nis a power to acquire it only for a public purpose. \\nThere is no power in the sovereign to acquire private \\nproperty in order to give it to private persons. \\nPublic purpose is a content of the power itself. \\nReference in this connection may be made to \\nWilloughby\\'s Constitutional Law (page 795). Therein \\nit is stated. \\n\"As between individuals, no necessity, however \\ngreat, no exigency, however imminent, no improve-\\nment, however valuable, no refusal, however unneigh-\\nbourly, no obstinacy, however unreasonable, no offers \\nof compensation, however extravagant, can compel or \\nrequire any man to part with an inch of his estate.\" \\nPublic purpose is an essential ingredient in the very \\ndefinition of the expression \"eminent domain\" as \\ngiven by Nichols and other constitutional writers, even \\nthough obligation to pay compensation is not a content \\nof the definition but has been added to it by judicial \\ninterpretation. The exercise of the power to acquire \\ncompulsorily is conditional on the existence of a public \\npurpose and that being so, this condition is not an \\nexpress provision of article 31(2) but exists aliunde \\nin the content of the power itself and that in fact is \\nthe assumption upon which this clause of the article \\nproceeds. \\nThe result of this discussion is that the scope \\nof article 31 ( 4) is limited to the express provisions of \\narticle 31 (2) and courts cannot examine either the \\nextent or the adequacy of the prov1S1ons of com-\\npensation contained in any law dealing with the 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMahajan/. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMahara;a\\xad\\ndhiraia Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMahajan/. 936 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\nacquisition of property compulsorily for public purpose \\nbut the barring provisions of article 31(4) <lo not in any \\nway touch the powers of the court to see whether the \\nacquisition has been made for public purpose. The \\nprovisions of this clause also Jo not take away the \\ncourt\\'s power to examine whether the legislature that \\nmade the law has acted in exercise of its law making \\npower within the lists or has merely made some other \\nlaw though it has ostensibly exercised its powers under \\na certain legislative head which cannot be used to \\nsupport the legislation. \\nAs regards the new articles 31-A and 31-B, they \\nmerely place beyond the reach of the c;ourt any enact-\\nment dealing with compulsory acquisition of property \\nwhich may infringe any of the provisions of Part III \\nof the Constitution ; in other words, article 13(2) of \\nthe Constitution cannot be called in aid to impugn the \\nvalidity of such statutes. \\nHaving determined the scope of article 31 ( 4), it is \\nnow convenie11t to examine the extent of the \\nprotection given by :i.rticle 31 (4) to the impugned \\nstatute. \\nMr. Das is to a great extent right in his contention \\n-the point was not seriously challenged by the learned \\nAttorney-Gcneral,-that the law under challenge in \\nthe matter of compensation is highly unjust or inequi-\\ntable to certain persons and in certain matters, and \\ncompensation in some cases is purely illusory. Be \\nthat as it may, the Constitution in express terms \\nprohibits an enquiry in a court of law into those \\nmatters. The same Constituent Assembly that provi-\\nded the guarantees in article 31 (2) in respect of pay-\\nment of compensation and provided the remedy \\n.in article 32 for enforcing the· guaranteed right, \\ntook awav that rcmedv in the case of the Bihar \\nand othe~ zamindari estates and substituted for \\nit the procedure of article 31(3) and (4), compliance \\nwith which wonld be sufficient to make tbe laws valid \\nand effective. However repugnant the impugned \\nlaw may be to our sense of justice, it is not possible S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 937 \\nfor us to examine its contents on the question of \\nquantum of compensation. It is for the appropriate \\nlegislature to see if it can revise some of its unjust \\nprovisions which are repugnant to all notions of justice \\nand are of an illusory nature. The courts\\' hands are \\ntied by the provisions of article 31 ( 4) and that which \\nhas been declared by the Constitution in clear terms \\nnot to be justiciable, cannot be made justiciable in an \\nindirect manner by holding that the same subject-\\nmatter which is expressly barred is contained impli-\\ncitly in some other entry and therefore open to exa-\\nmination. None of these provisions, however, fetter \\nthe power of the court to inquire into any other \\nmatters the cognizance of which is not expressly taken \\naway by the provisions of clause (4) and articles 31-A \\nand 31-B. \\nTherefore, the material point for determination is \\nwhether the acquisition of the estates is tor any public \\npurpose and if it be not so, the law can certainly be \\nheld to be unconstitutional. Mr. Das contended, and \\nin my opinion rightly, that jurisdiction to acqmre \\nprivate property by legislation can only be exercised \\nfor a public purpose. It may be the purpose of the \\nUnion, or the purpose of the State or any other public \\npurpose. Private property cannot be acquired for a \\nprivate purpose. The right to legislate under entry 36 \\npostulates the existence of a public purpose and the \\ncontention is that there was no public purpose behind \\nthe Act. The learned Judges of the High Court \\nnegatived this conten.tion on the ground that the ques-\\ntion whether there was a public purpose in support of \\nthe acquisition of the estates had been by implication \\ndecided by the Constituent Assembly and therefore \\nthe Court could not go into this matter. Shearer J. \\nsaid as follows :-\\n\"We are, in my opm10n, estopped from saying that \\nthe acquisition of estates and tenures is not an acqui-\\nsition for such a purpose.

Reuben J. \\nobserved as follows :-\\n\"From article 31, clause (2), it is clear that the \\nConstituent Assembly considered two requirements \\nas essential for compulsory acqumt10n, namely, a \\npublic purpose and provision for compensation. The \\nprotection which the Constituent Assembly gave \\nunder clauses ( 4) and ( 6) was confined to the latter \\nrequirement. Evidently, therefore, the Constituent \\nAssembly thought that protection was not reqaued \\nunder the other head, that is to say, the Constituent \\nAssembly regarded that nationalization of land as it-\\nself constituting a public purpose. \\nI would, therefore, hold that there is a \\npose for the impugned Act within the \\nclause (2) of article 31.\" \\nDas J. said as follows :-public pur-\\nmeaning of \\n\"There is, I think, clear indication in the Constitu. \\ntion of India itself that the expression \\'public purpose\\' \\nis to be understood in a wide and comprehensive \\nsense. Furthermore, there is indication that the \\nConstituent Assembly, representing the people of India \\nwhich made the Constitution, was itself aware of the \\nexistence of legislation of the nature of impugned Act. \\nThis is clear from clause ( 4) of article 31. As a matter \\nof fact, the Land Reforms Hill was pending at the \\ncommencement of the Constitution ........ If the legis-\\nlation then pending was not for a public purpose, it \\nwas, indeed, surprising that the Constituent Assembly \\ntried to save such legislation by means of the provi-\\nsions of clause (4) of article 31. One may, I think, \\nsay that there was an implied declaration by the \\nConstitue11t Assembly that such legislation was for a \\npublic purpose and such declaration will be given \\ndeference by the courts until it is shown to involve an \\nimpossibility. .. \\n, . \\n• \\n• .. -S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 939 \\nFor the reasons given above, I hold that the \\nimpugned Act does not fall for want of a public \\npurpose\". \\nLearned counsel challenged this view of the High \\nCourt and contended that article 31 ( 4) of the Constitu-\\ntion is no answer on this point and that the Act was \\nbad as it was silent on the question as to why the \\nzamindaris were being acquired ; that it only provided \\nfor the interception of rents which instead of being \\nrealized by the zami11dars would . go into the coffers \\n-0f the Government without any benefit being derived \\nby the tenants ; that private property could not be \\nacquired for merely augmenting the revenues of the \\nState; and that the only purpose that could be gather-\\n·ed from this Act was the ruination of a large class of \\npersons without any corresponding benefit to any sec-\\ntion of the community. It is said that there are \\n13,35,000 land-owners and tenure-holders m Bihar \\nand if an average family be taken to consist of four \\npersons, five and a half million people will be ruined \\nby this legislation, while the ryots will not. benefit in \\nany manner because all the lands excepting the waste \\nlands sought to be transferred are 111 the possession \\nand cultivation of the ryots and no part of the rent \\nrealisable from them Is being commuted for their \\nbenefit. It IS pointed out that the waste lands were. \\nsufficient to meet the requirements of villagers for \\ngrazing (;attle and for pasture and that in effect the \\nacquisition of the estates was for the purpose of crea-\\nting one machine-ridden and red-tapist super-landlord \\nby depriving a substantial portion of the public of \\ntheir means of livelihood. \\nThe learned counsel proceeded to say that nationali-\\nzation ·of land may be the policy of the party in power \\n·but this is not a public purpose which involves benefit \\nto the community. Reference in this connection was \\nmade to the decision in Hamabai Pramjee Petit v. \\nSecretary of State for India (1), where it was observed \\n:that the phrase \"public purpose\" whatever it . may \\n(l) (1915) 42 I.A. 44. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMahajan/. 1952 \\nThe State af \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaia\\xad\\ndhiraia Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMahaian ]. 940 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952} \\nmean, must include a purpose, that is, an object or \\naim, in which the general interest of the community as \\nopposed to the particular interest of individuals 1s \\ndirectly and vitally concerned. The impugned Act, it \\nwas contended, did not fall within this definition of \\n\"public purpose\". Reference was also made to Vol. II \\nof Cooley\\'s Constitutional Limitations, at page 744, \\nwherein it is said as follows :-\\n\"The purpose must be public, and must have \\nreference to the needs or convenience of the public, \\nand no reason of general pnblic policy will be sufficient \\nto validate other transfers when they concern existing \\nvested rights.\" \\nFinally, it was urged tl1at there was nothing definite \\nor tangible in the Act or in the views of the legisla-\\ntures which gave any indication of the public purpose \\nfor which the estates were being acquired and all that \\ncould be gathered was that the legislature did not \\nknow its own mind at all and on a vague notion of some \\nfuture policy directed the acquisition of the estates. \\nIn my opinion, it will not serve any useful purpose· \\nto examine each and every argument that was address-\\ned to us by the learned counsel. There can be no. \\nmanner of doubt that acquisition of private property \\nby legislation under entries 33, 36 and 42 can only be \\nmade either for purposes of the Union or for purposes \\nof the State or for a public purpose and that it is un-\\n•1ecessary to state in express terms in the statute itself \\ntne precise purpose for which property is being taken, \\nnrovided from the whole tenor and inten<lment of the \\nAct it could be gathere<l that the property was being \\nacquired either for purposes of the State or for pur-\\nposes of the public and that the intention was to \\nbenefit the community at large. It may be conceded \\nthat the present statute does not disclose the legis-\\nlature\\'s mind as to what it would ultimately do after \\nthe estates arc vested in the State Government. \\nPerhaps the State Government has not yet made up· \\n.its mind how and for what purposes the lands and \\nthe tenures acqtiired will be utilized. The statute • • \\n• ,. \\' \\n• \\n.. \\' S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 941 \\nprovides m section 34 for the establishment of a land \\ncommission whose function it will be to advise the \\nGovernment as to its agranan policy. Be that as it \\nmay, it seems to me that m spite of the criticism \\nlevelled against the Act by the learned counsel, it \\ncannot be said that the Act would fall because it fails \\nto postulate a public purpose. The Act 1s intituled \\n\"The Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950\". The preamble \\nof the Constitution says that India has been con-\\nstituted into a Sovereign Democratic Republic to \\nsecure ·to all its citizens justice, social, economic and \\npolitical. Article 39 of the Directive Principles of \\nState Policy states as follows :--\\n\"The State shall, in particular, direct its policy \\nt!owards securing that the ownership and control of \\nthe material resources of the community are so dis-\\ntributed as best to subserve the common good ; and \\nthat the operation of the economic system does not \\nresult in the concentration of wealth and means of \\nproduction to the common detriment.\" \\nNow it is obvious that concentration of big blocks of \\nland in the hands of a few individuals is contrary to \\nthe principle on which the Constitution of India 1s \\nbased. The purpose of the acquisition contemplated \\nby the impugned Act therefore is to clo away with the \\nconcentrat;on of big blocks of land ancl means of pro-\\nduction in the hands of a few individuals and to so \\ndistribute the ownership and control of the material \\nresources which come m the hands of the State as to \\nsubserve the common good as best as possible. In \\nother wor<ls, shortly put, the purpose behind the Act \\nis to bring about a reform in the land distribution \\nsystem of Bihar for the general benefit of the commu-\\nnity as advised. The legislature is the best judge of \\nwhat is good for the community, by whose suffrage it \\ncomes into existence and it is not possible for this \\nCourt to say that there was no public purpose behind \\nthe acquisition contemplated by the impugned statute. \\nThe purpose of the statute certainly 1s m accordance \\nwith the letter and spirit of the Constitution of India. \\nIt is fallacious to contend that the object of th1 Act is 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaliaraja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMahajan/. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\n<Jf Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMahajan/; 942 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\nto ruin five and a half million people in Bihar. All \\nlands in khas possession of all these persons have not \\nbeen made the subject-matter of acquisition. Their \\nhomesteads, tbeir mineral wealth except mines not in \\noperation have not been seriously touched by the pro-\\nvisions of the Act. Various other exemptions have \\nalso been made in their favour in the Act, apart from \\nthe provisions as to compensation which in the case \\nof small zamindaris can by no means be said to be of \\nan illusory character. It is <liflicult to hold in the pre-\\nsent day conditions of the world that measures adopt-\\ned for the welfare of the community and sought to be \\nachieved by process of legislation so far as the carry-\\ning out of the policy of nationalization of land is con-\\ncerned can fall on the ground of want of public pur-\\npose. The phrase \"public purpose\" has to he con-\\nstrued according to the spirit of the times in which \\nparticular legislation is enacted and so construed, the \\nacquisition of the estates has to be held to have been \\nmade for a public purpose. \\nThese observations. however, have no application \\nto the acquisition of arrears of rent. On the face \\nof the statute, acquisition of fifty per cent. of \\nthese arrears was for the private purpose of the \\nzemindars and the other fifty per cent. was either \\nfor supplementing the revenues of the State or for \\nsecuring means for payment of compensation to \\nthe zemindars. The purpose is to discharge the obli-\\ngation of the acquirer to pay the price. The same \\nobservations apply to clause 23 (f) of the statute. \\nThat provision has been made for the purpose of \\nnegativing partially the provisions of the Act regard-\\ning payment of compensation.

SUPREME COURT REPORTS 943 \\nproposition of law that property of individuals can-\\nnot be appropriated by the State under the power of \\ncompulsory acquisition for the mere purpose of adding \\nto the revenues of the State. \"The principle of com-\\npulsory acquisition of property,\" says Cooley (in \\nVol. II at p. 113, Constitutional Limitations) \"is \\nfounded on the superior claims of the whole com-\\nmunity over an individual citizen but is applicable \\nonly in those cases where private property is wanted \\nfor public use, or demanded by the public welfare \\nand that no instance is known in which it has been \\ntaken for the mere purpose of raising a revenue by \\nsale or otherwise and the exercise of such a power is \\nutterly destructive of individual right. Taking \\n~10ney under the right of eminent domain, when \\n1t must be compensated in money afterwards is \\nnothing more or less than a forced loan. Money or \\nthat which in ordinary use passes as such and which \\nthe Government may reach by taxation, and also \\nrights in action which can only be avai~able when made \\nlo produce money, cannot be taken under this power.\" \\nWillis in his Constitutional Law, at page 816, \\noffers the same opm1on. Nichols on \"Eminent \\nDomain\" (Vol. I, at page 97) has expressed a con-\\ntrary opinion and reference has been made to the \\ndecision in Cincinnati v. Louisville etc., R. Co. (1). An \\nexamination of this case, however, does not disclose \\nthat any such proposition was stated therein. It was \\nheld in that case that a Bill to restrain the enforce-\\nment of a State statute regulating fire insurance· rights \\nwas a valid law in the State of Kansas. It was not \\nnecessary to decide in this case whether under the \\ncompulsory acquisition power the State has the power \\nto acquire choses in action or money, but it cannot be \\n. seriously disputed that such an acquisition amounts \\nto a forced loan and that the desired result can be \\nmore appositely obtained in exercise of the police \\npower of the State than of the power of eminent domain \\nor compulsory acquisition of property , and that com-\\npensation in such a case is the same amount of money \\n(1) 223 U.S. 390. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMahajan/. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMahajan]. 944 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\nthat is being taken and in the case of a chose in action \\nthe amount of money that it would produce. In this \\nsituation it cannot be held that fifty per cent. of the \\noutstanding arrears was compensation in any sense of \\nthat expression for this acquisition. The true posi-\\ntion is that the State took over all the arrears and \\ndecided to refund fifty per cent. of them and forfeit \\nthe rest. The validity of this acquisition has to be \\ndecided independently of the acquisition of the \\nestates. It has no connection with land reform or \\nwith\\' any public purpose. It stands on the same \\nfooting as other debts due to zamindars or their other \\nmovable properties, which it was not the object of the \\nAct to acquire. As already stated, the only purpose \\nto support this acquisition is to raise revenue to pay \\ncompensation to some of the zamindars whose estates \\nare being taken. This purpose does not fall within \\nany definition, however wide, of the phrase \"public \\npurpose\" and the law therefore to this extent is un-\\nconstitutional. \\nOne or two illustrations of the public purpose in-\\nvolved in this provision will bring O\\\\lt its true character. \\nIn Appeal No. 299 of 1951, the arrears of Darbhanga \\nRaj 011 26th September, 1950, was a sum of \\nRs. 30,81,967. Half of this amount is payable to \\nthe Raj and the other half stands forfeited. In the \\ncase of Raja P. C. Lal (Appeal No. 330 of 1951), the \\nrents due were Rs. 10,26,103, and in Appeal No. 339 \\nof 1951, the amount is Rs. 9,52,937. \\nNext it was contended that the impugned Act is a \\nfraud on the Cunstitution and therefore void. It was \\nsaid that the Act, while pretending to comply with \\nthe Constitution, evades and invades it ; that the Act \\nmerely pretends to comply with the Constitution when \\nit says that it provides for payment of compensation \\nbut in effect it has produced a scheme for non-payment \\nof compensation by shift and contrivance. Reference \\nwas made to certain provisions of the Act of a con-\\nfiscatory nature, already noticed in this judgment. \\nSection 9 was mentioned under which mines in the \\n-course of development and fetching no income yet \\' -\\n. ~ \\n• \\nI • S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 945 \\nvest in the State without payment of compensation. \\nNo compensation has been made payable in respect of \\nforests or trees which were not fetching any income \\nat the date of vesting. In a nutshell, it was contended \\nthat the object of the Act was to acquire properties of \\nthe zemindars by payment of compensation (so-called) \\nout of the moneys belonging to the zemindars them-\\nselves and that in some cases they had not only to \\ngive up their estates for nothing but would have to \\npay something, in addition, to the State, if the prin-\\nciples specified in the Act were to apply. It was \\npointed out in the case of the Maharaja of Darbhanga \\nthat his zemindari would be acquired by the State \\nGovernment without paying anythiµg but that the \\nMaharaja would have to pay out of his own money \\nsix lakhs to the Government. In Case No. 330 of \\n1951 (Raja P. C. Lall), it was said that Government \\nwould get the zemindari free, while in Case No. 339 of \\n1951 the State will get the zemindari and two and half \\nlakhs out of the arrears, while in Case No. 331 of 1951 \\n(Chota Nagpur appe;:il) the zemindari will be acquired \\non payment of a small sum of Rs. 14,000 only. No-\\nthing will be payable to the zamindars out of the \\npublic exchequer. Attention was drawn to the obser-\\nvations of Shearer J. in the following passage :-\\n\"The legislature, it is clear, are optimistic enough \\nto hope that this reform may conceivably be effected \\nwithout raising any great loan. The conclusion, to \\nmy mind, is irresistible that the intention is to take \\nover the great estates in the province, paying no com-\\npensation or the most inadequate compensation, and \\nout of the considerable profits which are likely to be \\nderived from them, to take over, in course of time, the \\nremaining estates and tenures. In other words, a \\ncomparatively small minority belonging to this parti-\\ncular class are to be expropriated without compensa-\\ntion or with the most inadequate compensation in \\norder that, when the great majorit} are expropriated, \\nthey receive compensation which will not be in-\\nadequate and may, quite possibly, in many cases, be \\nmore than adequate.\" 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMahajan/. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMahajan /. 946 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952J \\nMr. Das vehemently contended that the statute \\nwas a fraud on republican Constitution which promised \\nto deprive no one of his property without payment of \\ncompensation ; that it pretended to make elaborate \\nprovisions for paying it but that by shift and con-\\ntrivance it has provided for the evasion of its pay-\\nment. Reference was made to a passage in Moran \\nProprietary Ltd. v. Dy. Commissioner of Taxation for \\nNew Sottth Wales (\\'),which is in these terms:-\\n\"Cases may be imagined in which a purported \\nexercise of the power to grant financial assistance \\nunder section 96 would be merely · colourable.

Reliance was placed \\nin this connction on the observations of Abbott C.J. \\nin Fox v. Bishop of Chester(\"), which are in these \\nterms:-\\n\"Our judgment is founded upon the language of the \\nStatute 31 Eliz. c. 6 and the well-known principle of \\nlaw, that the provisions of an Act of Parliament shall \\nnot be evaded by shift or contrivance.\" \\n(!)

They could not be permitted \\nunder that power to pass a law that operates to the \\ndetriment of those persons and the object of which \\nprovision is to deprive them of the right of compen-\\nsation to a certain extent. \\nIn this connection it is no~ convenient to examine \\nthe contention of the learned Attorney-General as to \\nthe interpretation of legislative head entry 42 of \\nList III. He contended that under this head it was \\nopen to the Parliament or the State Legislature to make \\na law laying down the principles which may result in \\nnon-payment of compensation or which may result in \\nnot paying any compensation whatsoever. I cannot \\npossibly assent to any such construction of this entry. \\nThe entry reads tfius:-\\n\"Principles on which compensation for property \\nacquired or requisitioned for purposes of the Union or \\nof a State or for any other public purpose is to be \\ndetermined, and the form and manner in which such \\ncompensation is to be given.\" \\nThis head of legislation seems to have been expressly \\nmentioned in the Concurrent List not only in view of \\nthe accepted principle of law that in cases of compul-\\nsory acquisition of property compensation has to be \\nmade but also in view of the clear and mandatory \\nprovisions of article 31(2) which require that a law \\nauthorising the taking or acquisition of propeny will \\nbe void if it does not provide for payment of compen-\\nsation for the property acquired or does not either fix \\nthe amount of compensation or specify the principles \\non which and the manner in which the compensation \\nis to be determined and given. The power of legisla-\\ntion in entry 42 is for enacting the principles of deter-\\nmining such compensation and for paying it. The \\nprinciples to be enacted are for determining such \\ncompensation and for paying it. The principles \\nto be enacted are for determining the equivalent \\nprice of the property taken away. It may be that \\nthe determination of the equivalent may be left \\nfor ascertainment on the basis of certain uniform rul(\\'s; 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\n•• Maharaja-\\ntlhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSin1h \\nof Darbhan111 \\nand Otliers. \\nMahaian /. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMahajan f. 950 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [19521 \\nfor instance, it may be laid down that the principles \\nfor determining compensation will be the rental basis or \\nthe market value of the property etc. But it is difficult \\nto imagine that there can be any principles fur non-\\npayment of compensation or for negativing the pay-\\nment of compensation. No principles are required to \\nbe stated for non-payment of compensation. A simple \\nstatement that no compensation will be paid is quite \\nenough to attain the object. I know of no principles __ ior \\ndetermination of compensation which result in its non-\\npayment except in the Act under notice. AlCfcgiS: \\nlative heads have to be reasonably construed and the \\npower given under entry 42 is a positive power given· \\nto bring about the resuit of payment of compensation \\nand not non-payment of the same. The key words \\nin the entry are \"compensation\" and \"given\". Any-\\nthing that is no.related to compensation or the giving \\nof it cannot be justified by legislation under entry 42, \\nReference was made in this connection to the United \\nProvinces v. Atiqa Begum(\\'), in which it was held that \\nthe descriptive words under the legislative head \\n-\"collection of rents\" are wide .enough to permit k~-\\nlation in respect of remission ·of rents and that under \\nitem 22 of the Government of India Act, 1935, the \\nlegislative head \"forests\" include the power to legis-\\nlate with respect not only to afforestation but also to \\ndisafforestation and that the legislative head \"fisheries\" \\nwould include the power to legislate on the prohibi-\\ntion of fishing altogether. In my opinion, these \\nanalogies have no application . to the construction of \\nthe language employed in entry 42, These entries are \\nnot in par[ materia to entry 42. Perhaps a more \\nanalogous case on the point is the decision in Attorney\\xad\\nGeneral for Ontario v. Attorney-General for t!te Domi\\xad\\nnion (2).

The real \\nquc:stion to decide in all such cases is whether what \\nreamins is so inextricably bound up with the part \\ndeclared invalid that what remains canno~ independ-\\nently survive, or, as it has sometimes been put, \\nwhether on a fair review of the whole matter it can be \\nassumed that the legislature would have enacted at \\nall that which survives without enacting the part that \\nis ultra vires.

Section 43 of the Act empowers the \\nState Government to make rules for carrying out the \\npurposes of the Act. Clause (p) is in these terms :-\\n\"The proportion in which compensation shall be \\npayable in cash and in bonds and the manner of pay. \\nment of such compensation under sub-sections (2) and \\n(3) of section 32.\" \\nIt seems clear that the Act has made sufficient provi-\\nsion for enforcing its provisions if section 32(2) is read \\nwith the provisions contained in section 43 and it \\ncannot be said that the Act is unenforceable for this \\nreasi;.>n. \\nThe last point urged by M. Das was that section 32 \\n(2) of the Act was void as in it legislative functions \\nhad been abdicated by the legislature in favour of the \\nexecutive. A two-fold attack was levelled against this \\nprov1S1on. Firstly, it was said that the Constitution \\nhaving _in entry 42 of List III of the Seventh Schedule \\nvested authority in the legislature to make laws on \\nthe question of the principles as to the payment of \\ncompensation and the manner and form of its payment, \\nin other words, it h;, ving trusted these matters to the \\ncare, judgment and wisdom of the legislature, it had \\nno power to delegate these matters to the executive. \\nSecondly, it was contended that section 32 (2) dele-\\ngated essential legislative power to the executive which \\nit was incompetent to do. Reference was made to the \\nopinion of this court in Special Reference No. 1 of \\n1950. \\nThe matters alleged to have been delegated are \\nthese:-\\n1.

The determination of the period of redemption \\nof the<e bonds. \\n3. The period of interval between the several instal-\\nments. \\nThe section enacts that the compensation payable \\nshall be paid in cash or in bonds or partly in cash and \\npartly in bonds. It therefore determines the principle \\nthat the payment of compensation will be in these two \\nforms. It further enacts that bonds shall be either \\nnegotiable or non-negotiable and non-transferable. It \\ntherefore also determines the nature of the bonds \\nthat would be issued. It further enacts that the \\npayment, if made in bonds, will be paid in forty \\nequal instalments. It is obvious that the time \\nof redemption of the bonds will be co-terminous \\nwith the period of the instalments. It has further \\nenacted that the bonds will carry interest at the rate \\nof two and a half per cent. What has been left to \\nthe executive is the question of the determination of \\nproportion in which compensation is to be paid in \\ncash or in bonds and the fixation of the interval of the \\ninstalments. It seems to me that the delegation to this \\nextent is permissible in view of the decision of this \\nCourt in The State of Bombay v. Narottamdas fetha\\xad\\nbai (\\') and the decision of their Lordships of the Privy \\nCouncil in Queen v. Burah(2). The legislature applied \\nits mind to the question of the method and manner of \\npayment of compensation. It settled its policy and \\nthe broad principles. It gave the State Government \\nthe power to determine matters of detail after having \\nsettled vital matters of policy. It cannot be said that \\nthe legislature did not apply its mind to the subject-\\nmatter of the legislation and did not lay down a policy. \\nThe proportion in which compensation was payable in \\ncash or in bonds or whether the whole of it was to be \\npaid in cash is a matter which only the State Govern-\\nment could fix and similarly, the interval of instal-\\nments and the period of redeemability of the bonds \\nwere also matters of detail which the; · executive could \\n(1) [1951] S.C.R. 51. (2) (1877) 5 I.A. 178. 1 ,). . \\nI S.C.R SUPREME COURT REPORTS 955 \\n.more oppositely determine in exercise of its rule-mak-\\nmg power. It cannot be said in this case that any \\nessential legislative power has been delegated to the \\nexecutive or th.at the legislature did not discharge the \\ntrust which the Constitution had reposed in it. If the \\nrule-making authority abuses its power or makes any \\nattempt to make the payment illusory, the expropriat-\\ned proprietor will not be without a remedy. \\nFor the reasons given above, I am of the opinion \\nthat section 32(2) of the Act cannot be held bad on the \\nground that it is a piece of unregulated delegation of \\nlegislative power. \\nMr. Das\\'s contention in Cases Nos. 319, 327, 330 \\nand 332 of 1951 and in the other cases in which he \\nappeared were the same. \\nMr. Chaudhury appearing in Cases Nos. 309 and 328 \\nof 1951 raised a large number of points, some of which \\nare covered by the arguments of Mr. P. R. Das, which \\nI have discussed already. The rest seem to me to \\nbe unsubstantial but it is necessary to notice a few \\nof them upon which great stress was laid by the \\nlearned counsel. Mr. Choudhury contended that the \\nfield of legislation on the question of principles of \\ndetermination of compensation and the mode and \\nmanner of payment of such compensation was already \\noccupied by the Land Acquisition Act which was an \\nexisting law of Parliament and, t~refore, the State \\nLegislature could not enter on this field and legislate \\non the principles of payment of compensation. This \\nargument really has no force, because the provisions \\nas to a~sessment of compensation enacted in the Land \\nAcquisition Act only apply to acquisitions that are \\nmade by notification under that Act. Its provisions \\nhave no application to acquisitions made under either \\nlocal or central laws unless they are specifically made \\n.applicable by the provisions of these statutes. \\n·Another point put forward by him, that articles \\n31-A and 31-B of the Constitution cannot affect \\npending cases cannot be seriously entertained because \\nretrospectivity is writ large on the face of those · 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\n. v. \\nMaharaia\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMahajan/. 1952 \\nThe Stau of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaia\\xad\\ndhiraia Sir \\nKa111eshwar-\\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMahajan/. 956 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\narticles. Similarly, I cannot but regard as un-\\nsubstantial his contention that transference of \\nestates of zamindars to the State under the provisions \\nof a statute requires registration. The only other \\npoint seriously pressed by him iis that the Bihar \\nLegislature had no power to issue bonds without \\ncomplying with the procedure laid down in article 293 \\nof the Constitution. It is enough to state with regard \\nto this poiint that the stage for issuing bonds has not \\narrived as yet. When the State legislature issues \\nbonds which are unenforceable or which it is not \\ncompetent to issue, the contention can possibly be \\nraised. \\nMr. Chakravarty who appeared m three cases, \\nNoo. 326, 337, and 344 of 1951, urged that as regards \\ntrust properties, the Bihar legislature had no power \\nto acquire them without payment of full compensa-\\ntion as certain educational and charitable institutions \\nwould thereby be seriously affected. He was, however, \\nunable to point out how the Bihar Legislature had no \\npower to acquire trust properties. \\nMr. Raghav Saran who appeared in Cases Nos. 310, \\n311 and 329 of 1951, raised a novel point that the \\nAct not being reasonable and just, the Supreme \\nCoun ·had jurisdiction to declare it void on that \\nground. He was unable to support his argument \\non any reasonable basis. The constitutionality of \\na statute passed by a competent legislature cannot \\nbe challenged on the ground that the law made is \\nnot reasonable or just. \\nCounsel who appeared in Cases Nos. 307, 313, 315, \\n320, 321, 322 and 331 and Petition No. 612 of 1951 \\nmerely adopted the points urged by Mr. P.

In my opinion, the Bihar Land \\nReforms Act of 1950 is not unconstitutional, with the \\nexception of the provisions contained in section 4(b) \\nand 23(f) of the Act and these provisions alone must \\nbe held to be void and inoperative. \\nAs regards section 23(f) the Bihar Land Reforms \\nAct, my learned brother has based his decision on the \\nground that the provision of this clause constitutes a \\nfraud on the Constitution, and although in enacting \\nthe provision, the legislature purported to exer-\\ncise its powers under entry 42 of the Legisla-\\ntive List III in Schedule VII of the Constitution, \\nin reality i:t is a colourable exercise of that power \\nunder which a thing has been done wliich is \\nnot contempleted by that entry at all and lies \\noutside its ambit. I agree with the line of reasoning \\nadopted by my learned brother in this connection \\nand there is nothing further which I can usefully \\nadd. \\nAs regards section 4 (b) it has been held by my \\nlearned brother that the provision of this clause is un-\\nconstitutional as it does not disclose any public pur-\\npose at all. The requirement of public purpose . is \\nimplicit ~ compulsory acquisition of property by \\nthe State or, what is called, the exercise of its power \\nof eminent domain. This condition is implied in the \\nprovision of :irticle 31 (2) of the Constitution and \\nalthough the enactment in the present case fulfills \\nthe requirements of clause (3) of article 31 and as 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKarneshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhangrr \\nand Others. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKanieshwar \\nSingh \\ncf Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nMukherjea /. 958 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\nsuch attracts the operation of clause (4) of that \\narticle, my learned brother has takien the view that \\nthe bar created ·by cleause ( 4) is confined to the ques-\\ntion of compensation only and does not extend to the \\nexistence or necessity of a public purpose which, \\nthough implicit in, has not been expressly provided \\nfor by clause (2) of the article. For my part I would \\nbe prepared to assume that clause ( 4) of article 31 \\nrelates to everything that is provided for in clause (2) \\neither in express terms or even impliedly and con-\\nsequently tl1e question of the existence of a public \\npurpose does not come within the purview of our \\nenquiry in the present case. Even then I would hold \\nthat the same reasons, which have weighed with my \\nlearned brother in declaring section 23(f) of the \\nimpugned Act to be unconstitutional, apply with \\nequal, if not greater, force to section 4 (b) of the Act \\nand I have no hesitation in agreeing with him as \\nregards his decision on the constitutionality of this \\nprovision of the Act though I would prefer to adopt \\na different line of reasoning in support of the same. \\nSection 4 (b) of the Bihar Land Reforms Act lays \\ndown, as one of the results of the publication of a \\nnotification under section 3(1) of tl1e Act that \"all \\narrears of rents........ and all cesses together with \\ninterest, if any, due thereon for any period prior to \\nthe date of vesting which were recoverable in respect \\nof the estate or tenure by the proprietor or tenure-\\nholder and the recovery of which was not barred by \\nany law of limitation shall vest in and be recoverable \\nby the State\". The explanation attached to the \\nclause further provides that for purposes of the \\nclause the expre\"ion \"arrears of rent\" shall include \\narrears in respect of which suits were pending \\non the date of vesting or in respect of which \\ndecrees were obtained before that date together with \\ncosts allowed by such decrees. Under section 24 \\nof the Act, 50\" lo of these arrears of rent are directed \\nto be added to the amount of compensation money \\npayable for the estate or interest calculated in accord- JP \\nance with the provisions of the Act. f \\' \\n.. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 959 \\nThe arrears of rent whether merged in decrees or \\nnot, whic.h were due to the landlord for a period ante-\\nrior to the date of notification under section 3(1) of the \\nAct, were undoubtedly the property of the landlord, \\nirrespective of his interest in the estate or tenure which \\nis the subject-matter of acquisition. Such arrears could \\nnot vest in the State as a normal result of acquisition \\nof any estate or interest therein, and it is \\ncon..:cdcd by the learned Attorney-General that article \\n31-A of the Constitution has no application so far as \\nthese arrears of rent are concerned. The arrears of rent, \\ntherefore, are the subject-matter of separate and indi-\\npendent acquisition i1nrler the Rih:i.r I,,~nd Reforms \\nAct, if the word \"acquisition\" can at a11 be appropriate \\nto cases of this description. \\nIt cannot be disputed that in every Government \\nthere is inherent authority to appropriate the \\nproperty of the citizens for the necessities of the \\nStatt: and constitutional provisions do not confer this \\npower though they generally surround it with safe-\\nguards. The restrains invariably are that when pri-\\nvate property is taken, a pecuniary compensation must \\nbe paidC1). Thus eminent domain is an attribute of \\nsovereign power supposed to be tempered by a princi-\\nple of natural law which connects its exercise with a \\nduty of compensation(2). \\nPossibly under the impression that the sacredness of \\nprivate property should not be confided to the un-\\ncertain virtues of the party in power for the time \\nbeing, the Constitution-makers of our country have \\ndeclared it as one of the fundamental rights that no \\nproperty shall be taken possession of or acquired for \\npublic purpose unless the law directing its appropriation \\nmakes provision for compensation in the manner laid \\ndown in article 31 ( 2). Clause ( 4) of article 31 does not \\ndo away with the obligation to pay compensation ; it \\nmerely lays down that laws which are referred to in \\nclause (3) of the article would be immune from judi-\\ncial scrutiny on the ground of inadequacy of the \\n(I) Vi de Cooley on Constitutional Limitations, Vol. II, p. 1110. \\n(2) Vide Encyclopaedia of Social Science, Vol. V, p. 493. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaia\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga· \\nand Others. \\nMukhtriea f. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\nJlziraja Sit \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. 960 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952) \\namount of compensation or the impropriety of the \\nprinciple for assessing the same as provided for in the \\nenactment. The clause presupposes however that the \\nenactment is the result of a valid exercise of a legis· \\nlative power conferred on the legislature by the \\nappropriate entries in the Legislative Lists and if the \\nlegislature acts outside these entries or, under the pre-\\ntence of acting within them, does something which is \\nin flat contradiction with its contents, clause ( 4) of \\narticle 31 could not be invoked to afford any protec-\\ntion to such legislation. \\nClause ( 4) (b) of the impugned Act read with the \\nprovision of section 24 of the same, empowers the \\nState Government to appropriate all the arrears of \\nrent due to a landlord at a particular time and the \\nonly obligation it casts on the Government in this \\nrespect is to allow 50\"/o of the amount thus appro-\\npriated as sol\\'lllium for the so-called acquisition. On \\nthe face of it the legislative provision purports to \\nhave been made in exercise of the powers conferred on \\nthe State legislature under entry 36 of List II and \\nentry 42 of List III of Schedule, VII of the Constitu-\\ntion. In my opinion, this is a mere device or pretence \\nand the real object which the legislation intended to \\naccomplish is to deprive a man of his money which is \\nnot ordinarily a subject-matter of acquisition, in exer-\\ncise of what are known as powers of eminent domain \\nby the State, without giving him anything in ex-\\nchange; and under the guise of acting under entry 42 \\nof List III, the legislature has in truth and substance \\nevaded and nullified its provisions altogether. \\nThe general p_rinciples, which distinguish the powers \\nof eminent domain from other powers of the State \\nunder which the sacrifice of the proprietary interest \\nof a citizen could be demanded or imposed, are fairly \\nwell-known. As has been observed by Cooley in his \\nConstitutional Limitations \"every species of pro-\\nperty which the public needs may require and \\nwhich the Government cannot lawfully appropriate \\nunder any other right, is subject to be seized and .; 1 \\n,.. \\' \\nJ \\n• t • .S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 961 \\n~ppropriated under the right of eminent domain(\\'). \\nMoney as such and also rights in action arc ordinarily \\nexcluded from this List by American jurists and for \\ngood reasons(2). There could be no possible necessity for \\ntaking either of them under the power of eminent \\ndomain. Money in the hands of a citizen can be \\nreached by the exercise of the power of taxation, it \\nmay be confiscated as a penalty under judicial order \\nand we can even conceive of cases where the State seizes \\n-or confiscates money belonging to or in the hand~ of a \\ncitizen under the exercise of its \\'police\\' powers on the \\nground that such fund may be used for unlawful pur-\\nposes to the detriment of the interest of the community. \\nBut, as Cooley has pointed out(3), taking money under \\nthe right of eminent domain when it must be \\neompc\"\\'ated by money afterwards could be nothing \\nmor-e or less than a forced loan and it is difficult to \\nsay Stat it comes under the head of acquisition or re-\\nquisitioning of property as described !n entry 36 of \\nList II and is embraced within its ordinary connot-\\nation. \\nIt is said by the learned Attorney-General that the \\nsubject matter of acquisition in the present case is not \\nmoney but choses in action. It seems to me that there \\nis no difference in principle between them because a \\n-chose in action can be available to the acquiring \\nauthority only when it is made to produce money ; \\nOtherwise it is useless altogether(3). \\nAssuming however that entry 36 of List II is wide \\nenough to include acquisition of money or a right of \\naction, I have no hesitation in holding that in Qr~vid\\xad\\ning for compensation in respect of such acquisition the \\nlegislature has made a colourable use of entry 4:l oi \\nList III and has thereby defeated the purpose of that \\nentry altogether. Entry 42 of List III speaks of \\n\"principles on which compensation for property \\nacquired or requisitioned for the purposes of the Union \\nor of a State or any other public purpose is to be \\n( l) Sec Cooley on Constitutional Limitations, Vol. II, p. 1113. \\n(2) Cooley, Vol. If\\\\ p. 1118; Willis on Constitutional Law, p. 816. \\n(3) Vidc Cooley on Constitutional Limitations, Vol. II, p.1118,F.

This is a descrip-\\ntion of legislative head and I agree with the learned \\nAttorney-General that in deciding the competency of the \\nlegislation under this entry, we are not concerned with \\nthe justice or propriety of the principles upon which the \\nassessment of compensation is to be made under a parti-\\ncular legislation nor are we concerned with the justice· \\nor otherwise of the form or manner in which such \\ncompensation is to be given. I do not, however, \\nagree with the learned Attorney-General for the \\nreasons already given by my learned brother in his \\njudgment that legislation under this head need not pro-\\nvide for any compensation at all and that a legislative \\nprovision which declares that no compensation is to be \\ngiven comes within the ambit of this legislative head. \\nSuch construction is repelled by the very language of \\nthe entry which speaks of giving compensation and \\nnot of denying or witholding it. Stripped of all dis-\\nguise, the net result of the impugned provision is that \\nit would be open to the State Government to appro-\\npriate to itself half of the arrears of rent due to the \\nlandlord prior to the date of the acquisition without \\ngiving him any compensation whatsoever. Taking of \\nthe whole and returning a half means nothing more or \\nless than . taking half without any return and this is \\nnaked confiscation, no matter in whatever specious \\nform it may be clothed or disguised. The impugned \\nprovision, therefore, in reality does not lay down any · • \\nprinciple for determining the compensation to be paid \\nfor acquiring the arrears of rent, nor does it say any-_ \\nthing relating to the form of payment, though appar-\\nently it purports to determine both. This, in my \\nopinion, is a fraud on the Constitution and makes the \\nlegislation, which is a colourable one, void and in\\xad\\noperative. The learned Attorney-General has con-\\ntended that it is beyond the compentency of the Court \\nto enter into a question of bona fides or mala fides of \\nthe legislature. In a sense this is true. If the legis-\\nlature is omnipotent, tl:;i.e mqtives, which impel it to \\nenact a particular law, are absolutely irrelevant; arid S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 963 \\non the other hand, if it lacks competence the question \\nof motives does not at all arise. But when a legis-\\nlatU.re has a limited or qualified power and has got to \\nact within a sphere circumscribed by legislative \\nentries, the question, whether in purporting to act \\nunder these entries, it has, in substance, gone beyond \\nthem and has done certain things which cannot be \\naccomplished within the scope of these entries, is really \\na question affecting the competency of the legislature. \\nIn such cases, although the legislation purports to have \\nbeen enacted under a particular entry, if it is really \\noutside it, it would be void(1). It has been suggested \\nin course of the argument on behalf of the State that \\nin the present case the Government in the exercise of \\nits powers of acquisition could acquire the arrears of \\nrent and as the arrears were still unrealised, it was \\nquite legitimate and proper for the Government to \\ndeduct half of the gross amount as consideration for \\nthe trouble and expense that it would have to undergo \\nin the matter of realising these arrears. This would \\nmean that what the legislature intended is simply to \\nenable the Government to help the zamindars in \\nrealising the arrears\\' of rent and as a return for the help \\nwhich it is to render, the Government is given the \\nright to retain half of the arrears that were actually \\ndue. This could not possibly have been the real in-\\ntention of the legislature and I do not think that there \\nis any item in the long legislative lists framed by the \\nConstitution which empowers the legislature to inter-\\nfere with the legal rights of the landlord in this manner \\napart from special circumstances like indebtedness or \\notherwise and impose upon him an onerous obligation \\nto which he is not a consenting party. A legislation of \\nthis character is a complete novelty, the like 0£ which \\nhas seldom been witnessed before. The result is that \\nI concur in the order which has been made by my \\nlearned brother Mahajan J. in this case and I allow \\nthe appeals subject to the two modifications indicated \\nabove.

On September 11, 1950, that Bill received the \\nassent of the President and became the Act. The provi-\\nsions of the Act have been analysed and summai;ised in \\nthe judgment just delivered by Mahajan J. and it is \\nnot necessary for me to burden this judgment by \\nrecapitulating the same. On September 25, 1950, \\nthe text of the Act was published in the Official \\nGazette with a notification under section 1 (3) dated \\nSeptember 24, 1950, bringing the Act into operation. \\nA notification under section 3 of the Act dated \\nSeptember 25, 1950 vesting · the estates of certain \\nnamed proprietors was published in · the Official \\nGazette on the next day. This Notification having \\nbeen published in the Official Gazette, some of the \\nproprietors affected thereby instituted suits in the \\nSubordinate Courts in Bihar after giving the requ1S1te \\nnotice under section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure \\nand prayed for a declaration that the Act was uncon-\\nstitutional and void and that their title to the pro-\\nperties remained unaffected. Some of the other \\nproprietors filed applications in the High Court at \\nPatna under article 226 of the Constitution praying \\nfor the issue of appropriate writs, directions or orders. \\nThe State of Bihar filed its written statements in the· \\nsuits which were transferred to the High Court for \\ndisposal in exercise of its extraordinary Original Civil \\nJurisdiction. The suits and the applications were \\nheard together. As the issues involved grave ques-\\ntions of intcroretation of the Constitution, the suits \\nand applications were placed before a Special Bench \\' S.C.R.

All the learned Judges, for one \\nreason or another, repelled all the main contentions \\nof the proprietors but held that the Act was uncon-\\nstitutional in that it. denied to the proprietors equal \\nprotection of the laws guaranteed by article 14 of \\nthe Constitution. The High· Court rejected the plea \\nof the State that article 31 ( 4) of the Constitution by \\nreason of the words \"notwithstanding anything in \\nthis Constitution\" excluded article 14 at least in its \\napplication to the alleged inequality of compensation. \\nArticle 31(4) is in these terms:-\\n\"lf any Bill pending at the commencement of this \\nConstitution in the Legislature of a State has, after it \\nhas been passed by such Legislature, been reserved for \\nthe consideration of the President and has received \\nhis assent, then, notwithstanding anything in this \\nConstitution, the law so assented to shall not be \\ncalled in question in any court on the ground \\nthat it contravenes the provisions of clause (2).\" \\n. The State of Bihar obtained leave of the Patna \\nHigh Court under article 132 (1) of the Constitution \\nto appeal to this Court and preferred these appeals \\nbefore us. \\nIt may be mentioned here that the States of Uttar \\nPradesh and Madhya Pradesh also passed legislation \\nfor the abolition of zamindaries in their respective \\nStates and the validity of those legislations was also \\ncontested by the proprietors affected thereby. The \\nrespective High Courts of those States, however, up-\\nheld the validity of the respective State legislations \\nand the aggrieved proprietors came up to this Court \\neither on appeal or on substantive application under \\narticle 32.

Article 31-A \\nrelates back to the date of the Constitution and \\narticle 31-B to the respective dates of the Acts and \\nRegulations specified in the Ninth Schedule. It has \\nnot been disputed that the provisions of the above \\ntwo newly added articles have to be taken into con-\\nsideration in disposing of these appeals. \\nLearned counsel appearing for the respondents \\naccept the position that as a result of the con-\\nstitutional amendments tl1e impugned Act has \\nbeen removed from the operation of the provisions \\nof Part III of the Constitution including article 14 \\nand that the respondents cannot, therefore, complain \\nof the breach of the equal protection of the laws under \\narcicle 14 which was the only ground on which the \\nrespondents succeeded in the High Court.

What is urged is that the obligation \\nto provide for compensation is not a provision to be \\nfound exclusively in article 31(2) but that it is also \\nprovided for in other parts of the Constitution and .. \\n-S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 969 \\nthat, in so far as such obligation is found provided \\nelsewhere, the impugi:ed Act can well be challenged \\non the ground that it contravenes or is inconsistent \\nwith or takes away or abridges the provisions of those \\nother parts of the Constitution, for that ground of \\nchallenge has not been taken away by articles 31 ( 4), \\n31-A and 31-B, by reason of the delimiting words used \\ntherein. The argument is developed in the following \\nway. The State\\'s power to acquire private property \\nis, in essence, a power to compel the owner to sell his \\nproperty when the public interest requires it. Autho-\\nrity for this: proposition is to be found in Blackstone\\'s \\nCommentary (Broom\\'s Edn.) p. 165 and in Cooley\\'s \\nC,onstitutional Limitations, 8th Edn., Vol. II, p. 1201, \\nFootnote (3). Indeed, In some of the English statutes \\nfor compulsory acquisition of lands and hereditaments \\n(e.g. 5 & 6 Vic. C. 94 and 8 & 9 Vic. C. 18) the word \\n\"purchase\" was used to denote acquisition. As there \\ncan be no sale without a price, there can be no com-\\npulsory acquisition of private property without a pro-\\nvision for payment of just compensation, i.e., its \\nequivalent value in money. That the obligation to \\npay just compensation for compulsory acquisition of \\nprivate property is a principle of natural equity re-\\ncognised by all temperate and civilized governments, \\nthat the right to compensation is an incident to the \\nexercise of the power of eminent domain and that the \\none is so inseparably connected with the other that \\nthey may be siaid to exist, not as separate and distinct \\nprinciples but, as parts of one and the same principle \\nare well-established by a series of decisions of the \\nAmerican courts quoted by Harlan J. in Chicago, Bur\\xad\\nlinghton and Quincy. Railroad Company v. Chicago(1). \\nIn England Lord Dunedian in Attorney-General v. \\nDe Keyser\\'s Royal Hotel Ltd.(2), described the obli-\\ngation to pay compensation as \"a necessary con-\\ncomitant to taking\". It follows, therefore, that the \\nobligation to pay compensation is inseparable from \\nand is implicit in the power of acquisition. This obli-\\n(1) 166 U.S. 216; 41 L. Ed. 979.

R. Das, con-\\nnotes a compound concept, namely, the concept of a \\npower of taking on just terms and confines the very \\nlegislative competency under those entries within the \\nlimits of that compound concept. If, however, the \\nword \"acquisition\" in entry 36 in List II and entry \\n33 in List I does not by itself imply the obligation to \\npay just compensation, then, urges Mr. P. R. Das in \\nthe alternative, the words \"subject to the provisions \\nof entry 42 of List III\" occurring at the end of entry \\n36 in List II certainly brings in that obligation. On \\na plain reading of entry 36 in List II the power to \\nmake law with respect to matters specified therein is \\n\"subject to\", that is to say, \"conditional upon\" the \\nexercise of legislative power under entry 42 in List III. \\nThose conclud~ng words\\\\ Mr. P. R. Das says, import \\nthe obligation to provide for compensation as provided \\nin entry 42 in List III into entry 36 in I)st II and \\nthereby enlarge the content of the last mentioned \\n· entry so as to make it a legislative head comprising \\n\\\\he compound concept referred to above. The third \\nalternative position is that if the word \"acquisition\" \\nin entry 36 in List II does not, by itself, imply the \\nobligation to provide for compensation and if the \\nwords. \"subject to the provisions of entry 42 of \\nList !Ii\" do not import that obligation as stated \\nabove, entry 42 in List III should, nevertheles~, be \\nconstrued as conferring a power coupled with a duty, \\nso that if the law-making power under entry 33 in \\nList I or entry 36 in List II is at all exercised, the law-\\nmaking power under entry 42 in List III must, on the \\nprinciple laid down by the House of Lords in \\n/ulus v.

SUPREME COURT REPORTS 971 \\nList II but not having made any law laying down any \\nprinciple for determining what may, in the eye of the \\nlaw, be regarded as just compensation at all, the Act \\nis ultra vires and void. The arguments thus deve-\\nloped by Mr. P. R. Das undoubtedly have the merit \\nof attractive ingenuity and apparent cogency and \\ncertainly call for very careful consideration. \\nTo cut at the root of the above argument the learned \\nAttorney-General appearing for the appellant State \\ncontends that the impugned Act is a law made with \\nrespect to matters mentioned in entry 18 in List II and \\nnot under entry 36 in List II. The contention is that \\nit is essentially a leg~slation for land reforms and \\nalteration of land tenures. It is pointed out that the \\nAct eliminates the interests of all zernindars and in-\\ntermediate tenure-holders so that the State and the \\nactual tiller of the soil may be brought into direct \\nrelationship. Incidental to this primary object is the \\nacquisition of the various interests in the land. Re-\\nference is made to the cases of The United Province; \\nv. Mst. Atiqa Begum and Others(\\'), Thakur /agannath \\nBaksh Singh v. The United Provinces(2) and Megh Raj \\n-and Another v. Allah Rakhia and Others(8) in support \\nof the proposition that each entry in the list, which is \\na category or head of the subject-matter of legislation, \\nmust be construed as widely as possible so as to in-\\nclude all ancillary matters. This lien of reasoning \\nfound favour with Shearer J. but was rejected by \\nReuben J. and S. K. Das J. There is no doubt that \\n\"land\" in entry 18 in List II has been construed in a \\nvery wide way but if \"land\" or \"land tenures\" in that \\nentry is held to cover acquisition of land also, then \\nentry 36 in List II will have to be held as wholly \\nredundant, so far as acquisition of land is concerned, a \\nconclusion to which I am not prepared to assent. In \\nmy opinion, to give a meaning and content to each of \\nthe two legislative heads under entry Ht and entry 36 \\nin List II the former should be read as a legislative \\n(1) [1940] F.C.R. 110 at p. 134.

Further, the impugned Act purports to \\nacquire all arrears of rent and a la~ for acquisition of \\nthe arrears of rent cannot possibly be said to be a \\nlaw with respect to matters specified in entry 18 \\nin List II for it cannot be supposed to be a law \\nrelating to the collection of rent within the meaning \\nof that entry. On this point I find myself in agree-\\nment with Reuben J. and S. K. Das J. and I cannot \\naccept the arguments of the learned Attorney-General \\nto the contrary. Therefore, the arguments of Mr. P. R. \\nDas founded on entry 36 in List II and entry 42 in \\nList III cannot be rejected in limine but have to be \\nconsidered and I proceed to do so immediately. -\\nThat the obligation to pay compensation is con-\\ncomitant to, that is to say, accompanies, the power of \\ncompulsory taking of private property by the State \\ncannot be disputed. The first important question is \\nwhether this obligati\\'on is implicit in the term \"acquisi-\\ntion\" as used in entry 36 in List II, or in other words \\nwhether this obligation is to be inferred simply from \\nthe nse of that term as a part of the content or mean-\\ning thereof. In Attorney-General v. De Keyser\\'s Royal \\nHotel Limited (supra) Lord Dunedin pointed out that \\nthe power of acquisition was, in its origin, derived \\nfrom the prerogative of the Crown and that the pay-\\nment of compensation was originally a matter of \\nnegotiation and bargain between the Crown and the \\nsubject, but came to be determined later on by statutes \\nof local application and finally by statutes of general \\napplication and that, therefore, the Crown, which is \\nan assenting party to every statute, must, in effect, be \\nregarded as having consented to the exercise of its \\nprerogative being made subject to payment of compen-\\nsation regulated by statutes. In that case, however, \\nit was not disputed in arguments that the taking \\nitself was a matter of prerogative right. In the \\nUnited States of America the power of eminent \\ndomain was not originally, in terms, conferred on \\n• .. \\n-• • \\n., S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 973 \\nthe United States by any provision of the Federal \\nConstitution, but this power has always been recog-\\nnised to exist as an inherent attribute of the \\nsovereignty of the State. So far as the United States \\nare concerned, the Fifth Amendment by providing \\nthat private property shall not be taken for public use \\nwithout just compensation gave a constitutional recog-\\nnition to the right of eminent domain and, to protect \\nthe subjects, imposed a limitation on the exercise of that \\nright by the State. This indicates that the power of \\nacquisition and the obligation to pay compensation \\nare two separate and distinct concepts although the \\nsecond follows the first. If the obligation to pay com-\\npensation were an integral part of the concept or the \\nmeaning of \"taking\" itself, then this part of the Fifth \\nAmendment was wholly unnecessary. It follows, \\ntherefore, that the expression \"acquisition\" does not, \\nby itself and without more, import any obligation to \\npay ·compensation. It is urged by Mr. P. R. Das \\nthat entry 42 in List III really implements the obli-\\ngation implicit in entry 36 in List II and the two \\nentries are complementary to each other. If this obli-\\ngation were not implicit in entry 36 in List II then \\nwhere else, it is asked, is the obligation to pay \\ncompensation to be found ? The obvious answer is \\nthat that obligation is to be found in article 31(2) in \\n. Part III of our Constitution. The obligation to \\npay compensation may be introduced as a· part of the \\nlegislative power itself, in which case it becomes a \\ncomposite power, namely, a power to make law with \\nrespect to acqui.sition circumscribed by the· obligation \\nto provide for compensation. Thus in section 31 \\n(XXXI) of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitu-\\ntion Act the acquisition of property on just terms has \\nbeen made a head or category of legislative power of \\nthe Commonwealth Parliament. There the power is \\nnot to make a law for the acquisition of property sim-\\npliciter but is to make a law for the acquisition of \\nproperty on just terms which connotes that the legis-\\nlative power itself is circumscribed by the necessity \\nfor providing just terms. But there is no overriding 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKam~shwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhangt¥ \\nand Others. \\nDas/. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhan ga \\nand Others. \\nDas]. 974 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\nnecessity of constitutional law that I know of, or that \\nhas been brought to our notice, which requires that \\nthe obligation to pay compensation for the acquisition \\nof property must be made part and parcel of the very \\nlegislative power to make a law with respect to the \\ncompulsory acquisition of private property. It must \\ndepend on the provisions of the particular constitution \\nunder consideration. What do we find in our Con-\\nstitution ? We find that under article 246 Parliament \\nhas exclusive power to make laws with respect, inter \\nulia, to matters specified in entry 33 in List I, namely, \\n\"acquisition or requisitioning of property for the pur-\\nposes of the Union, that the State Legislatures have \\nexclusive power to make laws with respect, inter \\nalia, to matters specified in entry 36 in List II, namely, \\nthe \"acquisition or requisitioning of property except \\nfor the purposes of the Union subject to the provision \\nof entry 42 of List III\" and that both Parliament and \\nthe State Legislatures may make laws with respect to \\nmatters set forth in entry 42 in List III, namely, the \\nprinciples for determining the compensation and the \\nform and manner of giving such compensation. This \\nlegislative power of Parliament or of the State Legis-\\nlatures is, by article 245, made \"subject to the provi-\\nsions of this Constitution.\" One of the provil;ions 0f \\nthe Constitution is article 31 (2) under which no pro-\\nperty can be \"taken possession of or acquired for \\npublic purposes under any law authorising the taking \\nof such possession or such acquisition unless the law \\nprovides for compensation for the property and either \\nfixes the amount of compensation or specifies the \\nprinciples on which, and the mam:1er in which, the \\ncompensation is to be determined and given.\" The \\nscheme of our Constitution obviously is to provide the \\nthree things separately, namely, the power of making a \\nlaw for acquisition of property in article 246 read \\nwith entry 33 in List I and entry 36 in List II, the \\nobligation of such law to provide for compensation in \\narticle 31 (2) and the power of making a law laying \\ndown the · principles for determining such compen-\\nsation in article 246 read with entry 42 in List III. \\' \\n... • \\n.. \\n, f. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 975 \\nAccording to this scheme it is not necessary at all \\nto regard entry 33 in List I and entry 36 in List II, \\nwhich are mere heads of legislative power, as contain-\\ning within themselves any obligafion to provide for the \\npayment of compensation. In other words, it is not \\nnecessary to treat the obligation to pay compensation \\nas implicit in or as a part or parcel of these legislative \\nheads themselves, for it is separately and expressly \\nprovided for in article 31 (2). The well-known \\nmaxim expressum f acit cessare tacit um is, indeed, \\na principle of logic and common sense and not \\nmerely a technical rule of construction (See Broom\\'s \\nLegal Maxims, 10th Edn., p. 443 at p. 452). The \\nexpress provision in article 31 (2) that a law of \\nacquisition, in order to be valid, must provide for \\ncompensation, will, therefore, necessarily exclude all \\nsuggestion of an implied obligation to provide for \\ncompensation sought to be impo.i;.ted into the meaning \\nof the word \"acquisition\" in entry 36 in List II. \\nIn the face of the express provision of article 31 (2) \\nthere remains no room £or reading any such impli-\\ncation in the legislative heads. \\nMr. P. R. Das suggests, in the alternative, that if \\nthe obligation to provide for compensation is not \\nimplicit in the word \"acquisition\" itself as used in \\nentry 36 in List II that obligation is a~tracted and \\nmade a part and pared of that entry by reason of \\nthe words \"subject to the provisions of entry 42 of \\nList III\". The last mentioned words are, however, \\nnot to be found l.n entry 33 in List I and this pan of \\nMr. P. R. Das\\'s argument would lead to this anomal-\\nous result that while the obligation to provide for \\ncompensation is made a part of the legislative power \\nunder entry 36 in List II by virtue of its last few \\nwords quoted above, no such obligation is attractedt \\nand made part of the legislative power under entry 33 \\nin List I, and that, therefore, in making a law with \\nrespect to acquisition of property under entry 33 in \\nList I Parliament, unlike the State Legislatures, will \\nnot be bound to provide for any compensation at all. \\nThis cannot possibly be the intention of the framers 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nDas f. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nDas/. 976 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\nof our Constitution. Further, Mr. P. R. Das reads \\nthe words \"subject to\" as meaning \"conditional upon\" \\nthe exercise of the legislative power under entry 42 in \\nList III, that is to say, conditional upon fulfilling the \\nobligation to provide for compensation and the form \\nand the manner in which such compensation is to be \\ngiven. I agree with S. K. Das J. that the~ words \\n\"subject to\" have not the meaning sought to be given \\nuo them by Mr. P. R. Das but that they mean \"but \\nnot\" so as to indicate that the scope of entry 36 in \\nList II is restricted, that is to say, that the subject-\\nmatter of entry 42 in List III is not within the content \\nof entry 36 in List II. If entry 42 in List III were, \\nby reason of the words \"subject to the provisions of \\nentry 42 of List III\" occurring in -entry 36 in List II, \\nto be read as having been made a part of the content \\nof entry 36 in List II then it may well be argued \\nthat, in view of article 246, . Parliament will not \\nbe competent to maintain law with respect to \\nprinciples on wh\\'ich compensation is to be deter-\\nmined. It is in order to prevent this argument \\nand out of aqundant caution that -the subject-\\nmatter of entry 42 in List III has been excluded \\nfrom the content of entry 36. in List II by the words \\n\"subject to\" et cetera and Parliament may, therefore, \\nfreely make a law with respect to the matters thus \\nexcluded from entry 36 in List II and set forth as a \\nseparate and independent item in entry 42 \\'in List III. \\nThis consideration was not material in connection with \\nentry 33 in List I which explains the omission of the \\nwords \"subject to\" et cetera from that entry. \\nMr. P. R. Das finally urges that if the obligation to \\nprovide for compensation is not implicit in the word \\n\"acquisition\" in entry 36 in List II and if that obliga-\\ntion is not to be read into that entry even in view of \\nthe words \"subject to .............. \" at the end of it, \\neven then if the State exercises its power to make a \\nlaw with respect to acquisition of property under \\nentry 36 in List II it is the duty of the State Legisla-\\nture to make a law also with respect to matJters speci-\\nfied in entry 42 in List III on the principles that as • \\n• \\n. ..., • \\n• S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 977 \\nentry 42 in List III confers a power on the Legisla-\\nture for the protection of the interest of persons; whose \\nproperty is compulsunly acquired, such power must, \\ntherefore, be regarded as coupled with a duty to exer-\\ncise it. No authority has been brought to our notice \\nestablishing or even suggesting that the principle laid \\n·dawn by the House of Lords in Julius v. Lord Bishop \\nof Oxford (supra) has been extended to the exercise of \\nLegislative power and I am not prepared to assent to \\nthe proposition. Article 246 does not make it obli-\\ngatory for Parliament or the State Legislatures to \\nmake a law under any of the entries in any of the \\nLists in the Seventh . Schedule. Entry 42 in List III \\ndoes not, therefore, impo~e any duty upon Parliament \\nor the State Legislatures to make any law for payment \\nof compensation. What requires Parliament or State \\nLegislatures, when making . a law for compulsory \\nacquisition of private property, to provide for com-\\npensation and either to fix the amount thereof or \\nspecify the principles on which and the manner in \\nwhich the compensation is to be determined and given \\nis the provision of art\\'icle 31 (2). Entry 42 in List III \\nonly constitutes a legislative head under which Parlia-\\nment or the State Legislatures may make a law so as \\nto give effect to the obligation expressly imposed on \\nthem by article 31 (2). In view of the clear provision \\nof that article it is wholly unnecessary to read entry \\n42 in List III as imposing an implied duty on the \\nLegislature on the principle referred to in the Hoose \\nof Lords case. \\nThat the obligation to provide for compensation is \\nnot included in the content of the legislative power \\nu_nder entry 36 in List II, by itself or read with entry \\n42 in List III, will be made further clear when we come \\nto consider closely clauses (4) and (5) of article 31 and \\narticle 31-A. Article 31 ( 4) protects a law of the descrip-\\ntion mentioned therein against the provisions. of \\narticle 31 (2). It follows, therefore, that what is sought \\nto be protected by article 31 (4) is a law for the acqui-\\nsition or taking possession of property which does not, \\namongst other things, pro-ifide for compensation or \\n126 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nDas/. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaia\\xad\\ndhiraia Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nDas/. 978 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\ndoes not fix the amount or specify the principles on \\nwhich and the manner in which the compensation is \\nto be determined and given, for otherwise there would \\nbe no necessity for any protection. The question at \\nonce arises as to whether there is any legislative entry \\nin List II under which a law for acquisition or taking \\npossession of property without compensation can be \\nmade by a State Legislature. To test the validity of \\nMr. P. R. Das\\' s argument and to avoid the complica-\\ntion arising out of the residuary powers of Parliament \\nunder article 248 and entry 97 of List II I have taken \\nthe case of a law otf acquisition made by the legislatures \\nof a State which also come within article 31(4). Is \\nthere, then, any entry in List II under which a State \\nLegislature can make a law for acquisition without \\ncompensation or pub!\\'ic purpose ? Obviously there is \\nnone, except entry 36 in List II. If that entry by it-\\nself or read with entry 42 in List III has any impli-\\ncation as suggested, namely, that a law for acquisition \\nof property made under entry 36 in List II without a \\nprovision for compensation wiJll be beyond the legis-\\nlative compentency of the State \\\\Legislatures, then \\nthere is no other entry under which such a law can be \\nmade by a State Legislature and there can, therefore, \\nbe no point in making a prOIVision in article 31(4) for \\nprotecting, against article 31(2), a law which, on this \\nhypothesis, cannot be made at all. Article 31(4) postu-\\nlates a law which offends against 31(2) and so far as the \\nState Legislatures are concerned there is no entry in \\nList II except entry 36 under which such an offending \\nlaw may made by the State Legislatures. This cir-\\ncumstance unmiistakabRy establishes thait entry 36 in \\nList II, by itself or read with entry 42 in List III, ha.s \\nnot any such implication as is imputed to it. Likewise . \\ntak:e article 31(5) (b) (ii) which protects the provi-\\nsions of any law which the State may hereafter make \\nfor the promotion of public health or the prevention \\nof danger to life or property. The law wh\\'ich is thus \\nsought to be protected must also involved acquisition \\nof property without any provision. for · compe~sation, \\nfor otherwise there can be no occas10n or necessity for • \\n\"· \\n• -\\n• S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 979 \\nany protection against article 31 (2). A law of this \\nkind, in so far as such law provides for acquisition of \\nproperty, must necessarily be made by a State Legis-\\nlature, if at all, under entry 36 in List II. If Mr . \\nP. R. Das\\'s contentions were correct, a law for the \\npromotion of health or the prevention of danger to \\nlife or property involving the acquisition of property \\nwithout a provision for compensation, which is what \\nis sought to be protected from article 31 (2), can never \\nbe made, for the obligation to provide for compensa-\\ntion is, according to him, implicit \\'in entry 36 in \\nList II, by itself or read with entry 42 in List III, and \\nthere is no other entry under which a law may be \\nmade by a State Legislature with respect to acquisi-\\nf1on of property. It is futile to attempt to get over \\nthis anomaly by suggesting that clauses ( 4) and (5) (b) \\n(ii) of article 31 have been inserted in the Constitution \\nex abundanti cautela, for, if Mr. P. R. Das were correct \\nin his submission, no amount of caution was necessary \\nfor protecting a law that, ex hypothesi, cannot be made \\nat all. Similar arguments may as well be founded on \\narticle 31-A, for that article also protects a law from \\narticle 31 (2) which is in Part III of the Constitution. \\nIt is -suggested that article 31-A postulates a valid \\nlaw made by a competent legislature within the \\nambit of its legislative powers. If a State Legislature \\nin making a law for the acquisition of property for a \\npublic purpose under entry 36 in List II must pro-\\nvide for compensation then a law made conformably \\nwith this supposed requirement of that entry by a \\nState Legislature will require no protection ar all \\nagalnst article 31 (2), and article 31-A must be regard-\\ned as meaningless and unnecessary. Surely, that \\nconclusion is manifestly untenable. In my opinion \\nclauses ( 4) and (5) (b) (ii) of article 31 and article 31-A \\nclearly negative Mr. P. R. Das\\'s proposition. In my \\njudgment, for the reasons stated above, the major \\npremise in the arguments advanced by Mr. P. R. Das \\nunder the first head, namely, that the obligation to \\npay compensation is implicit in entry 36 in List II by \\nitself or read wiith entry 42 in list III is unsound. \\n8-10 S.

Further, it must be borne in mind that \\narticle 31 ( 4) which applies \"notwithstanding any-\\nthing in this Constitution\\'\\', will, by force of the very \\nwords, protect the Act against everi legislative in-\\ncompetency, if any arising out of the alleged non-\\ncompliance with the suggested implied provisions, if \\nany, of entry 36 in List II and entry 42 in List III. \\nIn my judgment the respondents are not, by reason of \\narticles 31 ( 4), 31-A and 31-B, entitled to call the Act \\nin question on the ground that it does not provide for \\ncompensation, whether the ground ~s formulated as a \\nbreach of article 31 (2) or of the implied provision, if \\nany,. of the legislative heads mentioned above. \\nIt will be noticed that the argument that the .Act \\nis unconstitutional is founded on the assumption that \\nit has not laid down any principle for determining \\ncompensation as required by entry 42 in List III and \\nthat the provision for compensation is wholly illusory. \\nChapter V of the Act deals with assessment of compen-\\nsation. Shortly put, the scheme is to start with the \\ngross assets which are taken to be synonymous with \\nthe gross income and then to make certain deductions \\ntherefrom and to arrive at the net assets. Then the \\ncompensation is to be calculated at a sliding scale 0£ \\nrates varying from 20 to 3 times of the net income. \\nTo the amount thus determined is to be added a moiety \\nof the accumulated arrears of rent etc. and the com-\\npensation for the mines and minerals as determined \\nunder section 25. Ex f acie, it cannot be disputed that \\nthe Act does prescribe some principles for determin-\\ning the compensation payable to the proprietor c.r \\ntenure-holder. It is, however, pointed out that the \\ndeduction of 5 to 20 per cent. of the gross assets as \\nand by way of cost of management is quite arbitrary. \\nIt is said that although it is well known that the per-\\ncentage of cost of management in relation to the \\nincome of a small estate is greater than that of a \\nlarger estate, yet the Act provides for deducting 20 per-\\ncent. of the gross assets in the case of proprietors 1952 \\nThe State •f \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanz11 \\nand Others. \\nDRs /. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaia\\xad\\ndhiraia Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh . \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nDas/. 982 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\nof the larger estates but only 5 per cent. in the \\ncase of the smaller estates. Objection is next taken \\nto the deduction of any amount under the head of \\nworks of benefit to raiyats the and also to the scale \\nof such deduction. These arguments, to my minct, \\ndo not, on close scrutiny, amount to saying tha:: \\nthe Act does not lay down any principle for determin-\\ning the compensation. The real underlying implica· \\ntion of these arguments, as I understand them, is that \\nthe principles are not good enough in that they do .not \\nproduce fair compensation. I do not think the Court \\ncan go into the policy of the legislation. All that the \\nCourt is concerned with is to see whether any principle \\nhas been laid down as mentioned in entry 42 in List III. \\nIt is true that the percentage of costs of management \\ncalculated on the basis of the income of a big estate is \\nless than that of a smaller estate, but it is quite clear \\nthat the Act has fixed the scale of deducion under \\nthis head and under the head of works of benefit \\naccording to the capacity of the proprietor or tenure-\\nholder to bear it. It is impossible to say that the \\nprovision for deduction for works of benefit to the \\nraiyats is not supported by any principle. A landlord \\n.is expected to spend money on works of benefit to his \\nraiyats, e.g., providing tanks and wells, irrigation, \\ncharitable dispensary, schools and so forth and be it \\nsaid to the credit of some of the landlords that in \\npractice they do spend money on this account. There-\\nfore, there is nothing wrong, when calculating the net \\nincome of a landlord, to deduct something which the \\nlandlords should and some of them often do, in prac-\\ntice, spend under this head. I see no absence of \\nprinciple in this provision. The rate of deduction, I \\nhave said, has been fixed according to the capacity \\nof the proprietors or tenure holdens. It has been \\nshown, and it is not denied that in many cases a \\ncalculation of the net income on the basis of the \\nprinciples laid down in in the Act operates to reduce \\nthe gross income to a very small net income. To take \\nonly one instance, the gross annual income of the \\nbarbhanga estate is about Rs. 47,85,069, the deduction • \\nj • \\n• .. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 983 \\nallowed by the Act is about Rs. 44,88,585, and the \\nnet income computed according to the principles laid \\ndown in the Act comes to about Rs. 2,96,484 or say \\nRs. 3 · lacs and the compensation payable to the \\nMaharajadhiraj of Darbhanga will be only rupees \\n9 lacs. It has also been shown that at least in one case, \\ne.g., iu the case of the Raja of Purnea the compensation \\ncalculated according to the principle laid down in the \\nAct works out at a deficit figure. The fact that in one \\nisolated case the calculation may work out in thi~ way, \\ndoes not, however, prove that no principle has been \\nlaid down. Indeed, in all other cases the principle laid \\ndown in the Act actually produces compensation, \\nhowever inadequate it may be said to be in some \\ncases. If a principle has been laid down, then the pro-\\nvisions of entry 42 in List III are amply satisfied and \\nno question of legislative incompetency can arise. If \\na principle has beeh laid down in the Act but that \\nprinciple does not in fact produce any compensation \\nin any rare case or adequate compensation in some \\ncases then the real complaint should be, not that no \\nprinciple has been laid down but, that the principle \\nlaid down does not produce what may be called just \\ncompensation. That result may offend aga·1nst the \\nprovisions of article 31 (2) but certainly not against \\nentry 42 in List III and in view of articles 31 ( 4), 31-A \\nand 31-B the Act cannot be challenged for non-com-\\npliance with article 31 (2). On the other hand, even \\nif i;t is held that no principle has, in fact, been laid \\ndown by the Act, as contended, then that fact not \\nonly amounts to a breach of the provisions of entry 42 \\nin List III but also constitues a breach of the provi-\\nsions of article 31 (2) which clearly and emphatically re-\\nquires the law to either fix the compensation or lay \\ndown the principles on which and the manner in \\nwhich the compensation· is to be given and a breach \\nof this \"provision\", call it a provision of article 31 (2) \\nor one of entry 42 in List III, cannot, for reasons \\nalready stated be questioned in view of articles 31 ( 4), \\n31-A and 31-B. It should also be remembered that \\narticle 31 ( 4) by reason of the words \"notwithstanding 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv • \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nDas/, 1952 \\n.

R. Das. But before passing on to the second \\nmain ground of attack I think it right to deal with a \\nfew subsidiary points canvassed before us. \\nIt is said that section 3 of the Act, which is its main \\noperative section, does not contemplate or authorise \\nthe acquisition of arrears of rent at all, for the notifi-\\ncation under that section only refers to the vesting of \\nthe estates or tenures in the State. It is, however, to \\nbe noticed that the consequeunce of issuing that notifi-\\ncation is that the arrears of rent including all that are \\nmentioned in clause (b) of section 4 are also to vest in, \\nand be recoverable by, the State. This vesting of the \\narrears of rent in the State necessarily implies the \\ntransfer of the rights of the proprietors or tenure-\\nholders to the State and this process must, therefore, \\namount to the acquisition of that right by the State, \\nTherefore, in effect, the Act does contemplate the \\nacquisition of the arrears of rent by the State. \\nOn the authority of a passage in Willis\\' Constitu-\\ntional Law, p. 816, it is argued that the power of \\neminent domain cannot be exercised with respect to \\nmoney and choses in action besides certain other un-\\nusual forms of property. This passage is . founded on \\ncertain earlier decisions of the American Courts. It is, \\nhowever, clear from Nichols on Eminent Domain, \\nVol. I, p. 99, paragraph 2, an<l the case of Cincinnati • \\n; • \\n·-\\ny • \\n\\\\. \\n-S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS \\nv. Louisville & N. R. Co.(1) cited therein that the \\nmodern view is that the right of eminent domain can \\nbe exercised on choses in action. In any case we are \\nto consider whether arrears of rent are \"property\" in \\nthe sense m which that expression ts used in our \\nConstitution and understood m our law. What are \\nthe arrears of rent but rents that have fallen due but \\nhave not been paid? It is not at all money in the till \\nof the landlord but it is a debt due by the tenants. It \\nis, therefore, nothing but an actionable claim against \\nthe tenants which is undoubtedly a species of \"pro-\\nperty\" which is assignable. Therefore, it can equally \\nbe acquired by the States as a species of \"pro-\\nperty.\" \\nIt is finally urged that the Act makes no provision \\nfor payment of compensation for taking this item of \\nproperty. It is true that in section 24 the \\nword \"compensation\" is used m connection \\nwith the taking of the estates or tenures and also \\nthe taking of mines and minerals but not in con-\\nnection with the fifty per cent. of the arrears of \\nrent which are directed to be added to the compen-\\nsation. But this prov1S1on for adding the fifty per \\ncent. of the arrears also appears in the chapter headed \\n\"Assessment of Compensation\" and, therefore, the \\nfifty per cent. of the arrears ts added m the process \\nof the assessment of the compensation. Further, \\nwhy is this: fifLY per cent. given to the proprietors or \\ntenure-holders at all unless it were for compensation? \\nIt ts pointed out that when the State takes away a \\nlac of· rupees and returns 50,000 rupees, it, in reality, \\npays no compensation but by this shift and contri-\\nvance only takes away thet other 50,000 rupees for \\nnothing. This argument sounds plausible at first but \\nis not founded on any good principle. This argument \\narises only because a moiety js paid back, as it were, \\nm the same com. If compensation for money were \\nmade, say, by g1vmg some land of the value of a \\nmoiety of the money taken, the same argument would \\nnot have been available and all that could be said \\n(1) 223 U.S. 390; 50 L.Ed .. 481. \\n1~7 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nDas/. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nDas]. 986 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\n• \\ni would have been that the land so given, not being \\nequivalent in value to the money compulsorily taken \\naway, could not be said to be a JUSt compensation. \\nThat argument, in view of articles 31(4), 31-A and \\n31-B, would , of course, have been futile. But I see no \\ndifference in principle or law when compensation for \\nacquisition of arrears is made in money. In such a \\ncase if only a moiety of the amount of arrears is \\nreturned the obvious complaint will be that the return \\nof 50,000 rupees is not fair or adequate compensation \\nfor taking away Rs. 1,00,000 and that complaint \\nmay have prevailed had there been no provision like \\nthose we have in articles 31(4), 31-A and 31-B. \\nApart from this, the argument completely overlooks \\nthe fact that the arrears of rent are not really cash in \\nthe till of the proprietor or tenure-holder but is only a \\nd~bt due by the tenants. What is the market value \\nof this book debt ? This debt will have to be realised, \\npossibly by suit followed by execution proceedings in-\\nvolving time and money in costs. Part of it, quite \\nconceivably, may not be realised at all. Therefore, the \\nState takes the risk< of realising or not realising the \\narrears of rent but irrespective of the results of its \\nefforts for their realisation the fifty per cent. of the \\narrears is in a lump added to the compensation. This, \\nto my mind, indicates clearly that compensation is in \\nfact paid for the arrears of rent and I am not prepared \\nto say that the payment of a moiety of the book debts \\nas compensation is so illusory as to amount to nothing, \\nas contended by Mr. P. R. Das. Even if it be inadequate, \\nthe grievance will be not that no principle has been \\nlaid down in the Act as required by entry 42 in \\nList III but, that the principle so laid down does not \\nproduce adequate compensation and there is, therefore, \\na contravention of the provisions of article 31(2). That \\ndefect cannot, however, _be made a ground of attack \\nin view of articles 31(4), 31-A and 31-B for reasons ex-\\nplained above. • \\nRe Ground B: The second point urged by Mr. P.R. \\'\\\\ \\nDas is that even if the Court does not accept the argu-· . \\nment as to the necessity for providing for compensation > \\n\" .. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 987 \\nbeing implicit in entry 36 in List II and entry 42 \\nin List III and holds that the respondents are, by \\nreason of the provisions of articles 31 ( 4), 31-A and \\n31-B, debarred from questioning the validity of the \\nAct on the ground that it does not provide for compen-\\ns.i.tion the respondents are, nevertheless, entitled to \\nchallenge the Act on the ground of the absence of a \\npublic purpose. That the existence of a public pur-\\npose is an essential prerequisite to the exercise of the \\npower of compulsory acquisition has not been disputed \\nby the learned Attorney-General. The contention put \\nforward on behalf of the respondents is that the neces-\\nsity for the existence of a public purpose as a condi-\\ntion precedent to compulsory acquisition of private \\nproperty is not a \"provision\" 0£ articl\\\\! 31 (2) but is a \\nrequirement of entry 36 in List II or entry 42 in \\nList III. The words \"for public purposes\" do occur \\nin article 31 (2) but it is said that there is a distinction \\nbetween a \"provision\" and an assumption. It is urged \\nthat article 31 (2) assumes a law authorising the taking \\nof possession or the acquisition of property for a public \\npurpose and provides that the property shall not be \\ntaken possession of or acquired even for that public \\npurpose unless the law also provides for compensa-\\ntion. It is, therefore, concluded that the only \"pro-\\nvision\" of article 31 (2) is that the law autho-\\nrising the taking of possession or the acquisition \\nof property for a public purpose must provide \\nfor compensation and it is this \"provision\" only \\nthat cannot be made a ground of attack on the \\nAct by reason of articles 31 ( 4), 31-A and 31-B of \\nthe Constitution. This argument has found favour \\nwith Reuben J. and S. K. Das J. The latter learned \\nJudge; after referring to a passage in his own judg-\\nment in the earlier case of Sir Kameswar Singh v. The \\nProvince of Bihar(1) concludes as follows :-\\n\"Clause (2), strictly speaking, does not, in express \\nwords, make \"public purposes\" a condition precedent \\n.to compulsory acquisition but rather assumes that \\nsuch acquisition can be for public purposes only ; it \\n<loes so by necessary implication.\" \\n(I) A.I.R. 1950 Pat. 392. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga . \\nand Others. \\nDas/. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaia\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nDas/. 988 SUPREME COURT REPORTS l1952] \\nThe learned Judge then refers to the following \\npassage in the judgment of my learned brother \\nMukherjea J. in Chiranjit Lal Choudhury v. The Union \\nof India & Others(\\') :-\\n\"Article 31 (2) of the Constitution prescribes a ·two-\\nfold limit within which such superior right of the \\nState should . be exercised. One limitation imposed \\nupon the acquisition of taking possession of private \\nproperty which is implied in the clause is that such \\ntaking away must be for public purpose. The other \\ncondition is that no property can be taken unless the \\nlaw which authorises such appropriation contains a \\nprovision for payment of compensation in the manner \\nlaid down in the clause.\" \\nI do not, however, see how the above observations \\nof Mukherjea J. in any way support the argument of \\nMr. P. R. Das that the existence of a public purpose is \\nnot a provision of article 31 (2) but is an inherent \\ncondition of any legislation for compulsory acquisition \\nof private property. It is significant that Mukherjea J. \\nrecognises that article 31 (2) \"prescribes\" a two-fold \\nlimit. Surely, a Emit which is \"prescribed\" by the \\narticles must be a provision · thereof. In any case, \\nwhat is implied in the clause must, nevertheless, \\nbe a provision of the clause, for the expression \\n\"provision\" is certainly wide enough to include \\nan implied as well as an express prov.1S1on. Be \\nthat as it may, I am prepared to go further and say, \\nfur reasons I shall presently explain, that the require-\\nment of a public purpme as an essential prerequisite \\nto compulsory acquisition is, if anything, essentially a \\nprovision of tha.t clause and an integral part of it. \\nArticle 31 is one of a group of articles included in \\nPart III of tl1e Constitution under the heading \"Funda-\\nmental Rights\". It confers fundamental right in so \\nfar as it protects private property from State action. \\nCh use (1) of the article protects the owner from being \\ndeprived of his property save by authority of law. A \\nclose examination of the language of clause ( 1) will. \\n(2) [ 1950] S.C.R. 869. • \\n\\' \\n• • \\n• S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 989 \\nshow that this immunity is a limited one and this will \\nat once be clearly perceived if we convert the negative \\nlanguage of clause (1) into positive language. In its \\npositive form clause (1) will read :-\\n\"Any person may be deprived of his property by \\nauthority of law\". \\nThe only limitation put upon the State action is the \\nrequirement that the authority of law is a prerequisite \\nfor the exercise of its power to deprive a person of his \\nproperty. This confers some protection on the owner \\nin that he will not be deprived of his property save by \\nauthority of law and this protection is the measure of \\nthe fundamental right. It is to emphasise this \\nimmunity from State action as a fundamental right \\nthat the clause has been worded in negative language. \\nLikewise, clause (2) is worded \\'m negative language in \\norder to emphasise the fundamental right contained \\ntherein. The enunciation of this fundamental right \\nnecessarily requires a statement of the ambit and \\nscope of the State action and to fix the ambit and \\nscope of the State action it is necessary to specify the \\nlimitations on the State action, for that limitation \\nalone i\\' the measure of the fundamental right. \\nClause (2) of the article, in its positive form, omitting \\nwords unnecessary for our present purpose, w111l read \\nas follows :-\\n\"Any property, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . may \\nbe taken possession of or acquired for public purposes \\nunder any law auhorising the taking of such \\npossession or such acquisition if the law provide for \\ncompensation for the property taken possession of or \\nacquired ............ \" \\nPut in the above form, the clause makes it clear at \\nonce and beyond any shadow of doubt that there are \\nthree limitations imposed upon the power of the State, \\nnamely, (1) that the taking of possession or acquisition \\nof property must be for a public purpose, (2) that such \\ntaking of possession or acquisition must be under a \\nlaw authorising such taking of possession or acquisition \\nand (3) that the law must provide for compensation 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv . \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nDas/, 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nDas/. 990 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952) \\nfor the property so taken or acquired. These three \\nlimitations constitute the protection granted to the \\nowner of the property and is the measure of his funda-\\nmental right under thi; clause. Unless these limita-\\ntions were provisions of the article, the article would \\nhave afforded no immunity at all. I am, therefore, \\nclearly of opinion that the existence of a public pur-\\npose as a prerequisite to the exercise of the power of \\ncompulsory acquisition is an essential and integral \\npart of the \"provisions\" of clause (2). If the require-\\nment of a public purpose were not a provision of \\narticle 31 (2), then it will obviously lead us to the un-\\ntenable conclusion that Parliament will be free under \\nits residuary powers under article 248 and entry 97 of \\nList I of the Seventh Schedule to make a law for ac-\\nquiring private property without any public purpose \\nat all and to the still more absurd result that while \\nParliament will have to provide for compensation \\nunder article 31 (2) in a law made by it for acquisitio• \\nof property for a public purpose it will not have to \\nmake any provision for compensation in a law made \\nfor acquisition of property to be made without a public \\npurpose. Such could never have been the intention of \\nthe framers of our Constitution. The existence of a \\npublic purpose as a condition precedent to the exercise \\nof the power of compulsory acquisition being then, as \\nI hold, a \"provision\" of article 31 (2), an infringement \\nof such a provision cannot, under articles 31 (4), 31-A \\nand 31-B, be put forward as a ground for questioning \\nthe validity of the Act. \\nMr. P. R. Das\\'s second line of argument on this \\nmain head is that the necessity for the existence of a \\npublic purpose is . implicit in entry 36 in List II and \\nthat the existence of a public purpose is also a re-\\nquirement of entry 42 in List III which is made a \\npart of entry 36 in List II by virtue of the words \\n\"subject to\" etc., appearing at the end of that entry \\nand his conclusion is that in the absence of a public \\npurpose the Bihar Legislature had no legislative com-\\npetency under those two entries to enact the impug-\\nned Act and that this ground of attack, is still available • \\n• \\n• \\n1 \\n• \\n• • \\n, S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 991 \\nto ·him notwithstanding the provisions of articles \\n31 (4), 31-A and 31-B. He does not rely on any other \\npart of the Constitution as insisting on the existence \\nof a public purpose as a prerequisite for compulsory \\nacquisition of private property. Entry 36 covers any \\npurpose except the purpose of the Union and is not, \\nin terms, limited to public purpose. Secondly, \\nthe argument based on the words \"subject to\" etc. at \\nthe end of entry 36 in List II which are supposed to \\nimport the provisions of entry 42 in List III into \\nentry 36 in List II is not well-founded and it becomes \\nobvious when we look at entry 33 in List I. There \\nare no words at the end of that entry as \"subject to\" \\netc. and, therefore, the alleged requirement of a public \\npurpose under entry 42 in List III cannot be said to \\nbe incorporated in entry 33 in List I. It would, there-\\nfore, follow that whereas under entry 36 in List II \\nwhich is to be read with entry 42 in List III by reason \\nof the words \"subject to\" etc. in entry 36 in List II \\nthe Legislature of a State can only make a law for \\ncompulisory acquisition of property for a public pur-\\npose, Parliament may, under entry 33 in Llst I which \\ndoes not attract entry 42 in List III, make a law for \\ncompulsory acquisition of property without a public \\npurpose. Such a result could never have been intend-\\ned by the Constitution. Besides, turning to entry 42 \\nin List III, I find nothing in support of Mr. P. R. Das\\'s \\ncontention. The words \"acquired or requisitioned for \\nthe purposes of the Union or of a State or for any \\nother public purpose\" in that entry are merely words \\ndescriptive of the preceding word \"property\". The \\nmatters comprised in entry 42 in List III, as a legisla-\\ntive head, are the principles for the determination of \\ncompensation and the form and manner of giv\\'ing \\nthe compensation for property which is described \\nas having been acquired· or requisitioned for \\nthe stated purposes. That entry cannot possibly \\nbe regarded as a legislative head for acquisition \\nof property and much less is the purpose or \\nprovince of that entry to lay down any requirement \\nof a public purpose as a condition precedent for the 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv • \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nDas/. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nDas]. 992 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\nacqms1t10n of any property. In my opm10n entry 42 \\nin List III is of no assistance to Mr. P. R. Das for this \\npart of his argument. Further, the reasons for which \\nI have discarded his . arguments as to the obligation to \\nprovide for compensation being implied in entry 36 in \\nList II by itself or read with entry 42 in List III will \\nalso apply to this contention mutatis mutandis and they \\nneed not be restated here. To put it shortly, the pro-\\nvisions of article 31 (2) which, as I have explained, \\nrequire the existence of a public purpose, will exclude \\nthe implication sought to be read into entry 36 in \\nList II and entry 42 111 List III. Secondly, what \\narticles 31 ( 4), 31-A and 31-B exclude is a challenge to \\nthe Act on the ground of contravention of the \"pro-\\nvision\" of clause (2). If the \"provision\" of clause (2) \\nof article 31 as to the necessity for the existence of a \\npublic purpose as a prerequisite to compulsory acquisi-\\ntion of property is also to be regarded as implicit in \\nthose two legislative entries, surely articles 31 (4), \\n31-A and 31-B and in particular article 31 (4) which \\ncontain the words \"notwithstanding anything in this \\nConstitution\" will protect the Act from such implied \\nprov!S!on, for reasons I have already explained. \\nMr. P. R. Das\\'s second main point must accordingly \\nbe rejected as untenable. \\nAssuming that the necessity for the existence of a \\npublic purpose is not a provision of article 31 (2) but is \\na provision only of entry 36 in List II and/or of \\nentry 42 in List III and that consequently articles 31 ( 4 ), \\n31-A and 31-B do not preclude the respondents from \\nchallenging the validity of the Act on the ground of \\nthe legislative incompetency arising out of the absence \\nof a public purpose, the question still remains whether \\nthere is in fact a public purpose within the meaning of \\nour Constitution to support the Act. It is to be noted \\nthat there is no recital of any public purpose . in the \\nAct itself, but it is conceded that this circumstance is \\nnot fatal to the validity of the Act. It is, however, \\nurged that this circumstance, nevertheless, shows that \\nthe Legislature had, at the time of the passing of the \\nAct, no public purpose in its view. It is claimed • S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 993 \\nthat, apart from the absence of any such recital, \\nthere is no indication whatever as to the existence \\nof any public purpose in any of the operative provi-\\nsions of the Act. It is not disputed that as a \\nresult of this enactment a very large sum of money \\nnow payable by the tenants as and by way of current \\nrent and arrears of rent to their respective landlords \\nwill be intercepted by the State but it is urged, on the \\nauthority of certain passages in Cooley\\'s Constitu-\\ntional Lirri1tations, 8th Edn., Vol. II, p. 1U8 (Foot-\\nnote 1) and in Professor Willis\\' Constitutional Law, \\np. 817, that the exercise of the power of taxation and \\nnot that of the power of eminent domain is the legiti-\\nmate means for swelling the public revenue. That the \\nAct has no public purpose to support it is sought to be \\nestablished by saying that ln Bihar the recorded pro-\\nprietors are about 13,35,919 in number and that \\nassuming that there are four persons in a family, \\nnearly five and a half million people will be ruined \\nas a result of this legislation, although the actual tillers \\nof the soil will derive no benefit whatever therefrom, \\nfor they will remain where they are and will have to \\ncontinue, as heretofore, to pay rJ.eir rent, instead of to \\ntheir present landlords, to the ~tate which, they will \\nfind, is no better than a ruthless machine unsusceptible \\nto any humane feeling. The contention is that the \\npublic purpose must be something definite, something \\ntangible and something immediate and that there must \\nbe some indication of its existence in the Act itself and \\nthat the State cannot take private property to-day and \\nsay that it will think of the public purpose at its \\nleisure. This leads me to a consideration of what \\nis a public purpose within the meaning of our \\nConstitution. \\nWe have been referred to some American authorities \\nfor ascertaining the meaning and implication of \"public \\nuse\", an expression which obviously is of a more \\nlimited import than the expression \"public purpose\" \\nused in our Constitution. Apart from this, a perusal \\nof the text books, e.g., Constitutional Law by Professor \\nWillis, p. 817 et seq., will immediately make it clear 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir · \\nKame sh war \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nDas/. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaia\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nDas f. 994 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\nthat the notion as to what is a \"public use\" is rapidly \\nchanging in America. Formerly \"public use\\'\\', meant \\na use by the public. According to the modern view \\n\"public use\" means useful to the public. The . passage \\nin Cooley\\'s Constitutional Limitations, Vol. II pp. \\n1139-40 quoted by S. K. Das J. of the Patna High \\nCourt summarises the position thus :-\\n\"No satisfactory definition of the term \"public use\" \\nhas ever been achieved by the Courts. Two different. \\ntheories are presented by the judicial attempts to des-\\ncribe the subjects to which the expression would apply. \\nOne theory of \"public use\" limits the application to \\n\"employment\"-\"occupation\". A more liberal and \\nmore flexible meaning makes it synonymous with \\n\"public advantage\", \"public benefit\". A little investi-\\ngation will show that any definition attempted would \\nexclude some subjects that properly should be included \\nin, and include some subjects that must be excluded \\nfrom, the operation of the words \"public use\". As \\nmight be expected, the more limited application of the \\nprinciple appears in the earlier cases, and the more \\nliberal agplication has been rendered necessary by \\ncomplex conditions due to recent d~velopments \"of \\ncivilization and the increasing density of population. \\nIn the very nature of the case, modern cond11tions and \\nthe increasing inter-dependence of the different human \\nfactors in the progressive complexity of a community \\nmake it necessary for the Government to touch upon \\nand limit individual activities at more points than \\nformerly\". \\nTo the like effect are the \\nbe found in Corpus r uris, \\npp. 552 and 553 under the \\nuse\":-following observations to \\nVol. XX, article 39, at \\ncaption \"What is a public • \\n• \\n\"No general definition of what degrees of public. good \\nwill meet the constitutional requirements for a ·\"public\\' \\nuse\" can be framed, as it is in every case a question of J \\npublic policy.

R. Das has drawn our attention to the decision \\nof the Judicial Committee in Hamabai ·Framjee Petit \\nv. Secretary of State for lndia(1). It should be borne \\nin mind that the Judicial Committee in that case had \\nto consider the meaning of the words \"public purposes\" \\noccurring in a lease of the 19th century. Even in \\n1914 the Judicial Committee did not think fit \\nto attempt a precise definition of the expression \\n\"public purpose\" and was content to quote with \\napproval the following passage from the judgment of \\nBatchelor J. \\': -\\n\"General definitions are, I think, rather to be \\navoided where the avoidance is possible, and I make \\nno attempt to define precisely the extent of the phrase \\n\\'public purposes\\' in the lease ; it is enough to say \\n. that, in my opinion, the phrase, whatever else it may \\nmean, must include a purpose, that is, an object or \\naim, in which the general interest of the community, \\nas opposed to the particular interest of individuals, is \\ndirectly and vitally concerned\". \\nAnd it is well that no hard and fast definition was \\nlaid down, for the concept of \"public purpose\" has \\nbeen rapidly changing in all countries of the world. \\nThe reference in the above quotation to \"the general \\n(1) (1915) L.R. 42 I.A. 44. \\n9-10 S.C.In1tia/7l 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaia\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nDas/. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja· \\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand-Others. \\nDas]. 996 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\ninterest of the community\", however, clearly indicates \\nthat it is the presence of this element in an object. or \\naim which transforms such object or aim ino a public \\npurpose. \\nFrom what I have stated so far it follows that \\nwhatever furthers the general interests of the com-\\nmunity as opposed to the particular interest of the in-. \\ndividual must be regarded as a public purpose. With \\nthe onward march of civilization our notions as to the \\nscope of the general interest of the community are fast \\nchanging and widening with the result that our old \\nand narrower notions as to the sanctity of the private \\ninterest of the individual can no longer stem the · , \\nforward flowing tide of time and must necessarily \\ngive way to the broader notions of the general interest \\nof the community. The emphasis is unmistakably \\nshifting from the individual to the community. \\nThis modern trend in the social and political \\nphilosophy is well reflected and given expression to in \\nour Constitution. Our Constitution, as I understand \\nit, has not ignored the individual but has endeavoured \\nto harmonise the individual interest with the paramount \\ninterest of the community. As I explained in Gopalan\\'s \\ncase (\\') and again in Chiranjit Lat\\'s case (supra) our \\nConstimtion protects the freedom of the citizen by \\narticle 19(1) (a) to ( e) and (g) but empowers the State, \\neven while those freedoms last, to impose reasonable \\nres~rictions on them in the interest of the State or of \\npublic order or morality or of the general public as \\nmentioned in clauses (2) to (6). Further, the moment \\neven this regulated freedom of the individual becomes \\nincompatible wi,th and threatens the freedom of the \\ncommunity the State is given power by article 21, to \\n<leprive the individual of his life and personal liberty \\nin accordance with procedure established by law, \\nsubject, of course, to the provisions of article 22. \\nLikewise, our Constimtion gives protection to the \\nright of private property by article 19 ( 1) ( f) not \\nabsolutely but subject to reasonable restrictions to be \\nimposed by law m the interest of the general public \\n(1) [1950] S.C.R. 88. 1 \\n• -,, ,. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS \\nunder clause (5) and, what is more important, as soon \\na:i the interest of the community so requires, the \\nState may, under article 31, deprive the owner of his \\nproperty by authority of law subject to payment of \\ncompensation if the deprivation is by way of acquisi-\\ntion or requisition of the property by the State. It is \\nthus quite clear that a fresh outlook which places the \\ngeneral interest of the community above the interes~ \\nof the individual pervades our Constitution. Indeed, \\nwhat sounded like idealistic slogans only in the recent \\npast are now enshrined in the glorious preamble to \\nour Constitution proclaiming the solemn resolve of the \\npeople of tills country to secure to all citizens justice, \\nsocial, economic and political, and equality of status \\nand of opportunity. What were regarded only \\nyesterday, so to say, as fantastic formulae have now \\nbeen accepted as directive principles of State policy \\nprominently set out in Part IV of the Constitution. \\nThe ideal we have set before us in article 38 is, to evolve \\na State which must constantly strive to promote the \\nwelfare of the people by· securing and making as effec-\\ntively as it may be a social order in which social, \\neconomic and political justice shall inform all the in-\\nstitutions of the national life. Under article 39 the \\nState is enjoined to direct its policy. towards securing, \\ninter alia, that the ownership and control of the \\nmaterial resources of the community are so distributed \\nas to subserve the common good and that the opera~ \\ntion of the economic system does not result in the con-\\ncentration of wealth and means of production to the \\ncommon detriment. The words \"public purposes\" \\nu.sied in article 23(2) indicate that the Constitution \\nuses those words in a very large sense. In the never-\\nending race the law must keep pace with the realities \\nof the social and political evolution of the cow1try as \\nreflected in the Constitution. If, therefore, the State \\nis to give effect to these avowed purposes of our Con-\\nstitution we must regard as a public purpose all that \\nwill be calculated to promote the welfare of the people \\nas envisaged in these directive principles of State \\npolicy whatever else that expression may mean. In 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaia\\xad\\ndhiraia Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nDas/. .I 1952 \\nThe State· of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nDas/. 998 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\nthe light of this new outlook what, I ask, is the pur-\\npose of the State in adopting measure~ for the acquisi-\\ntion of the zamindaries and the interests of the inter-\\nmediaries ? Surely, it is to subserve the common good \\nby bringing the land, which feeds and sustains the \\ncommunity and also produces wealth by its forest, \\nmineral and other r=urces, under State ownership or \\ncontrol. This State ownership or control over land is \\na necessary preliminary step towards the implementa-\\ntion of the directive principles of State policy and it \\n·cannot but be a public purpose. It cannot be overlooked \\nthat the directive principles set forth in Part IV of \\nConstitution are not merely the policy of any partic · \\ncular political party but are intended to be principles \\nfixed by the Constitution for directing the State \\npolicy whatever party may come into power. Further, \\nit must always be borne in mind that the object of \\n.the impugned Act is not to authorise the stray acquisi-\\ntion of a particular property for a limited and narrow \\npublic purpose but that its purpose is to bring the \\nbulk of the land producing wealth under State \\nownership or control by the abolition of the system \\nof land tenure which has been found to be archaic \\nand non-conducive to the general interest of the \\ncommunity. The Act also sets up a Land Com-\\nmission to advise the State Government generally \\nwith regard to the agrarian policy which it may \\nfrom time to time follow. It is impossible to say that \\nthere is no public purpose to support the Act. This \\nvery Bihar Act was before the Constituent Assembly \\nwhen it passed article 31 ( 4) and again when it took \\nthe trouble of amending the Constitution for saving \\nthis very Act. Would the Constituent Assembly have \\nthought fit to protect these Acts unless it were con-\\nvinced that this Act was necessary in -the general \\ninterest of the community \\'? I find myself in agree-\\nment with Reuben J. and S. K. Das J. that these cir-\\ncumstances also clearly indicate that the Constituent \\nAssembly regarded this Act as well supported by· a \\n.public ·purpose. ·To put a ·narrow· constniction on the \\nexpression \"public purpose\" will, to my mind, be to ., -, -•r S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 999 \\ndefeat the general purpose of our Constitution and the \\nparticular and immediate purpose of the recent \\namendments. We must not read a measure imple-\\nmenting our mid-twentieth century Constitution \\nthrough spectacles tinted with early nineteenth century \\nnotions as to the sanctity or inviolability of individual \\nrights. I, therefore, agree with the High Court that \\nthe impugned Act was enacted for a public purpose. \\nMr. P. R. Das then puts. up a narrow argument. \\nAssuming, says he, that, there is· in the Act a general \\npublic purpose for compulsory acqui>9ition of zamin-\\ndaries and tenures, there cannot conceivably be any \\npublic purpose in suport of the Act in so far as it \\nauthorises the taking of the arrears of rent or the \\ntaking away of 4 to 12! per cent. of the gross assets \\non the specious pka that the landlords must be \\nsupposed to spend that percentage of their gross \\nincome on works of benefit to the rayats of the \\nestates and, therefore, that part of the Act is beyond \\nthe legislative competence of the Bihar Legislature. \\nI regard this argument as unsound for more reasons \\nthan one. In the first place the existence of a public \\npurpose being, as I hold, a provision of article 31 (2), \\nits absence, if any, in relation to the arrears of \\nrent cannot, by reason of articles 31 (4), 31-A and \\n31-B be made a ground of attack against the Act. \\nSecondly, it is ari entirely wrong approach to pick \\nout an item out of a scheme .of land reforms and \\nsay that that item is not supported by a public pur-\\npose. One may just as well say that there is no \\npublic purpose in the acquisition of forests or of mines \\nand particularly of u::ideveloped mines, for such acqui-\\nsition has no bearing on a scheme of agrarian reforms \\nin that it does not improve or affect the conditions of \\nthe tillers of the surface of the soil. This, I appre-\\nhend, is not the right way of looking at things. The \\nproper approach is to take the &cheme · as a whole \\nand than examine whether the entire scheme of \\nacqms1t10n is for a public purpose. Thirdly, \\nI do not regard the deduction of 4 to 12! per cent. \\nof the gross assets as acquisition or confiscation 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga · \\nand Others. \\nDas/. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ntlhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhan ga \\nanti Others. \\nDas/. 1000 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\nat all, but I regard it, for reasons &tated above, \\nas a part of a principle laid down by the Act \\nfor the purpose of determining the amount of compen-\\nsation as required by article 31 (2) and entry 42 in \\nList III. Finally, I do not see why the taking over \\nof the arrears of rent, in the context of the acquisition \\nof zamindaries, is not for a public purpose. As I have \\nsaid, the acquisition of zamindaries and tenures is a \\nscheme for bringing about agrarian reforms and amelio-\\nrating the conditions of the tenants. The object is, \\ninter alia, to bring the tillers of the soil in direct con-\\ntact with the States so as to free them from the clutches \\nof rapacious landlords and make them the masters of \\ntheir holdings subject to payments of the dues to the \\nState. It is well-known that the bulk of the tenants \\nare in arrears with their rents and once the rents fall \\ninto arrear the tenants find it difficult to pay the \\ncurrent rent after liquidating a part of the arrears so \\nthat while they clear part of the old arrears the current \\nrent falls into arrear. According to annexure B (2) \\nto the affidavit of Lakshman Nidhi affirmed on J anu-\\nary 22, 1951, the total amount of Raiyati rent payable \\nby the various tenants in the different circles of the \\nDarbhanga Estate alone will exceed rupees three lacs. \\nIt is not quite clear whether all these arrears are due \\nfrom the actual rayats in the sense of actual tillers of \\nthe soil. But leaving out from consideration for the \\npresent purposes the arrears of rent due by the \\n-tenure-holders to their immediate superior tenure-\\nholder or to the zamindar it can safely be taken \\nthat the bulk, if not all, of the actual rayats \\nor tiiJ!ers of the soil are habitually and perpetually \\nin arrear with the rent of their holdings on \\naccount of financial stringency resulting from their \\nchronic indebtedness. In these circumstances if the \\nzamindaries and the tenures only are acquired under \\nthe Act leaving the zamindars and the tenure holders \\nfree to realise the huge arrears of rent due by the \\nactual cultivating tenants by legal process it will \\neventually results in the sale of the holdings of the \\nactual tenants or, at any rate, of their right, title and S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1001 \\ninterest therein and the possible purchase thereof by \\nthe zamindars or tenure-holders themselves at Court \\nsales in execution of decrees or by private sales forced \\nupon the tenants. The bulk of the actual tillers of the \\nsoil wiH then become landless labourers and the entire \\nscheme of land reforms envisaged in the Act will be \\nrendered wholly nugatory. If the acquisition of th~ \\nzamindaries and the tenures is, as I hold, dictated or \\ninspired by the sound public purpose of ameliorating \\nthe economic and political conditions of the actual \\ntenants, the self same public purpose may well require \\nthe acquisition of the arrears of rent so as to avert the \\nundesirable but inevitable consequences I have men-\\ntioned The Bihar Legislature obviouslly thought \\nthat the tenants in arears will have better treatment \\nand a more reasonable accommodation, in the matter \\nof the liquidation of the huge arrears, from the State \\nwhich will act under the guidance of the Land Com-\\nmission than from the expropriated landlords whose sole \\nsurviving interest in their erstwhile tenants will only \\nbe to realise as much of the arrears as they can from \\nthe tenants and within the shortest possible time \\nwithout any mercy or accommodation. The same re-\\nmarks apply to the acquisition of decrees for arrears \\nof rent. The overriding public purpose of ameliorating \\nthe conditions of the cultivating raya~ may well have \\ninduced the Legislature to treat the arrears of rent \\nand the decrees for rent differently from the other \\nordinary moveable properties of the zamindars or \\ntenure-holders, e.g., their money in the bank or their \\njewellery or ornaments with which the rayats \\nhave no concern and to provide for the acquisition \\nof the arrears and the decrees. In the premises, \\nthe second main ground of attack levelled by \\nMr. P. R. Das against the Act must be rejected. \\nI am, however, free to confess that if I could \\nagree with Mr. P. R. Das that these provisions \\n. of the impugned Act are bad for want of a public \\npurpose, I am not at all sure that I would not have \\nfound it extremely difficult to resist his further \\nargument that the entire Act was bad, for it might 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhira;a Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nDas/. 1952 \\nT lze State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\n. of Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nDas J. 1002 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\nnot have been very easy to presume that if the Bihar \\nLegislature had known that these provisions of the \\nAct might be held bad it would nevertheless have \\npassed the other parts of the Act in that truncated \\nform. The acquisition of the arrears of rent appears \\nto me to be an integral part of the scheme and inextri-\\ncably interwoven with it. Indeed, it may well have \\nbeen that the scheme of agrarian reform was not \\nconsidered by the Bihar Legislature to be at all capa-\\nble of easy implementation by the State without the \\nacquisition of the arrears of rent. As, however, I have \\ntaken the view that no par:t of the Act is bad for want \\nof a public purpose, I need not pursue any further the \\nquestion of the severability of the Act or to refer to \\nthe judicial decisions relied on by learned counsel on \\nboth sides. \\nRe Ground C: Mr. P. R. Das\\'s third point is that \\nthe Act constitutes a fraud on the Constitution, that \\nis to say, while it purports to be in conformity with \\nthe Constitution, it, in effect, constitutes a defiance of \\nit. The Act, according to him, pretends to comply \\nwith the constitutional requirements in that it sets \\nout to lay down certain principles on which compen-\\nsation is to be determined and the form and the \\nmanner in which such compensation is to be given \\nbut, in effect, makes out a scheme for non-payment of \\ncompensation. The Act, he urges, purports to pay \\nback fifty per cent. of the arrears of rent as compensa-\\ntion but in reality confiscates the other fifty per cent. \\nwithout any compensation. Further, under the guise \\nof deducting· 4 to 12f per cent. of the gross income \\nthe State is in reality appropriating a large sum under \\ntllli head. All this, he concludes, is nothing but pre-\\ntence or a mere shift and contrivance for confiscating \\nprivate property. The argument, when properly \\nunderstood, will be found to resolve itself into an \\nattack on the legislative competency of the Bihar \\nLegislature to pass this Act. On ultimate analysis it \\namounts to nothing more than saying that while \\npretending to give compensation the Act does \\nnot really give it. It is the absence of a provision S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1003 \\nfor just and adequate compensation that mak~ \\nthe Act bad, because, according to Mr. P. R. \\nDas, the legislative power under entry 36 in List \\nII and entry 42 in List III requires the making of such \\na prov1S1on. The failure to comply with this consti-\\ntutional condition for the exercise of legislative power \\nmay be overt or it may be covert. When h is overt, \\nwe say the law is obviously bad for non-compliance \\nwith the requirements of the Constitution, that is to \\nsay, the law is ultra vires. When, however, the non-\\ncompliance is covert, we say that it is a fraud on the \\nConstitution, the fraud complained of being that the \\nLegislature pretends to act within its power while in \\nfact it is not so doing. Therefore, the charge of fraud \\non the Constitution is, on ultimate analysis, nothing \\nbut a picturesque and epigrammatic way of expres-\\nsing the idea of non-compliance with the terms of the \\n·Constitution. Take the case of the acquisition of the ar-\\nrears of rent. It is said that the provision in the Act for \\nthe acquisition of arrears of rent is a fraud on the legis-\\nlative power given by the Constitution. I ask myself as \\nto why must it be characterised as a fraud ? I find nothing \\nin the Constitution which says that the arrears of rent \\nmust not be acquired and, therefore, there is no neces-\\nsity for any covert attempt to do what is not prohibit-\\ned. I have already explained that in a scheme of land \\n<eforms such as is envisaged in the Act the acquisition \\nof the arrears of rent may properly accompany the \\nacquisition of the zamindaries and the tenures. Where, \\nthen, does this theory of fraud come in? The answer \\nmust eventually be that a moiety of arrears are taken \\naway without compensation. Again, take the case of \\nthe acquisition of non-income-yielding properties. \\nWhy, I ask, is it called a fraud on the Constitution to \\ntake such property ? Does the Constitution prohibit \\nthe acquisition of such property ? Obviously it does \\nnot. Where, then, is the fraud ? The answer that \\ncomes to imy mind is that it is fraud because the Act \\nprovides for compensation only on the baSiis of income \\nand, therefore, properties which are at present \\nnon-income-yielding but whii;h have very rich 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga , \\nand Others. \\nDas f. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaia\\xad\\ndhiraia Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nDas 1-1004 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [19521 \\npotentialities are acquired without any compensation \\nat all. Similar answer becomes obvious in connec-\\ntion with the deduction of 4 to 12~ per cent. of \\nthe gross assets under the head \"Works of Benefit \\nto the Rayats\". On ultimate analysis, therefore, \\nthe Act is really attacked on the ground that it \\nfails to do what is required by the Constitution \\nto do, namely, to . provide for compensation for the \\nacquisition of the properties and is, therefore, ultra \\nvires. This, to my mind, is the same argument as to \\nthe absence of just compensation in a different form \\nand expressed in a picturesque and attractive langu-\\nage. I have already dealt with the question of \\nabsence of a provision for just compensation while \\ndealing with Mr. P. R. Das\\'s first point and I repeat \\nthat the obligation to provide for compensation is not \\nimplicit in entry 36 List II by itself or read with \\nentry 42 in Lisit: III but is to be found only in \\narticle 31 (2), that under entry 42 in List III the Act \\nhas laid down a principle for determining compensa-\\ntion and, therefore, there can be no question as to \\nlegislative incompetency for any alleged non-compli-\\nance with any supposed requirement said to be im-\\nplicit . in these entries. If the principles so laid down \\nin the Act do not in any rare case produce any com-\\npensation or do not produce adequate compensation \\nin some cases, such absence of compensation may be \\na contravention of article 31 (2) but in view of \\narticles 31 (4), 31-A and 31-B and particularly due to \\nthe words \"notwithstanding anything in this Constitu-\\ntion\" occurring in article 31 ( 4) it cannot be made a \\nground of attack on the Act, even though such ground \\nis formulated in a different but attractive language, \\nnamely, as a fraud on the Constitution. Accordingly, \\nthis point must also be rejected. I, however, repeat \\nthat if I took a different view I would still have the \\nsame difficulty as to the inseverability of the different \\nprovisions of the Act as I have hereinbefore \\nindicated. \\nRe. Ground D : Mr. P. R. Das\\'s fourth point is \\nthat the Act is unenforceable in that section 32 (2) .. \\nt I -\\n_, \\n• S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1005 \\nprovides for compensation in forty equal instalments \\nwithout specifying the period of interval between the \\ninstalments. In course of arguments, however, Mr. P. \\nR. Das has thought fit not to preSlil this point and \\naccordingly it does not require any refutation. \\nRe. Ground E : Mr. P. R. Das\\'s last main point is \\nthat the Act has delegated essential legislative \\nfunctions to the Effective Government and is, \\ntherefore, invalid. Article 31 (2) requires that the \\nlaw authorising the taking poss,ession or the acquisi-\\ntion of land for public purpose should provide \\nfor compensation for the property taken possession \\nof or acquired and should either fix the amount or \\nspecify the principles on which, and the manner in \\nwhich the compensation is to be determined and given. \\nEntry 42 in List III talks of principles on which com-\\npensation is to be determined and the form and the \\nmanner in which such compensation is to be given. \\nThe argument is that the Constitution has left to \\nParliament or the State Legislature the duty of specify-\\ning the principle on which, and the form and manner \\nin which the compensation is to be determined and \\ngiven but the Bihar Legislature by section 3 (22) of \\nthe Act has simply provided that the amount of com-\\npensation shall be paid i:n cash or in bonds or partly \\nin cash and partly in bonds and that the bonds shall \\nbe either negotiable or non-negotiable and non-trans-\\nferable and be payable in forty equal instalments and \\nhas \\'not laid down any decisive provision but has left \\nthe matter to the State Government to decide. It has, \\ntherefore, failed to discharge the duty which was \\nexpressly left to its knowledge, wisdom and patriotism. \\nMr. P. R. Das complains that the Legislature has \\nshirked its responsibility and delegated this essential \\nlegislative power to the State Government to be \\nexercised under rules made by itself under its rule-\\nmaking power under section 43 (2) (p). The question \\nof the propriety and legality of the delegation of legis-\\nlative power has recently been considered by this \\nCourt in In re The Delhi Laws Act, 1912 etc.(1).

When I look at the matter on \\nthe basis of the principles laid down in that case by \\nthe late Chief Justice and my learned brothers to \\nwhich Mr. P. R. Das has referred, I have to overrule \\nhis contention all the same. Here section 32 clearly \\nindicates that the Legislature has applied its mind to \\nthe problem and it has laid down the principle that \\nthe compensation may be paid in cash or in bonds or \\npardy in cash and partly in bonds and that if a \\npayment is to be made either wholly or partly in \\nbonds, these bonds may be either negotiable or \\nnon-negotiable and non-transferable. Having laid \\ndown the principle, the Legislature has, by a rule \\nmade under section 43 (3) (p), left it to the Execu-\\ntive to determine the proportion in which the \\ncompensation shall be payable in cash and in \\nbonds and the manner of such payment of com-\\npensation. These details, it will be observed, depend \\non special circumstances, e.g., the extent of the ability \\nof Government to pay, the extent of the necessities of \\nthe proprietors and many other considerations, with \\nwhich the Executive Government would be more \\nfamiliar than the Legislature itself. I am unable to \\naccept Mr. P. R. Das\\'s contention that this amounts \\nto a delegation of an essential legislative function \\nwithin the meaning· of the decision of my learned \\nbrothers. \\n. Mr. Sanjiva Chowdhuri has urged that the Land \\nAcquisition Act, 1894 being continued by the Con-\\nstitution and that Act which is a Central Act having \\nbeen extended by notilication in 1899 to Ramgarh \\nState for which he appears, the Central Act must \\napply to Ramgarh until the notification is withdrawn \\nand the impugned Act cannot apply for determining \\nthe compensation, for the field is already occupied by \\nthe Central Act of 1894. It may, however, be noticed \\nthat the provision for compensation in that Act • .. . S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1007 \\napplies only to lands acquired under that Act. It has \\nno application to lands acquired under other statutes \\nand, therefore, the provision for compensation of the \\nLand Acquisition Act cannot . apply to acquisitions \\nunder the Bihar Act and, therefore, the doctrine of \\noccupied field can have no application. In my opi-\\nnion there is no substance in this contention. \\nFor reasons stated above, I allow these appeals. \\nCHANDRASEKHARA ArYAR J.-The faits which have \\ngiven rise to these cases have been fully set out in the \\njudgment just now delivered by my learned brother \\nMahajan J. and need not be repeated. The conclu-\\nsions reached by him and Mukherjea J. have my \\nconcurrence. Ordinarily, I would have stopped with \\nthe expression of my agreement, but having regard to \\nthe importance of the guestion argued and the stakes \\ni,nvolved, I desire to add a few words of my own on \\nsome of the points discussed. \\nArticle 31 (I) of our Constitution provides \"No per-\\nson shall be deprived of his property save by autho-\\nrity of law\". \\nThere are three modes of deprivation-(a) destruc-\\ntion, (b) acquisition and ( c) requisition. Destruction \\nmay take place in the interests of public health or the \\nprevention of danger to life or property, but with this \\nwe are not now concerned. In the case of \"acquisition\", \\nthere is an element of permanency, and in the case of \\n\"requisition\" there is an element of temporariness. \\nExcept for this distinction, both modes stand on the \\nsame footing, as regards the rights of the State \\nvis-a-vis the rights of the private citizens. \\nUnder the Constitution, when property is requisition-\\ned or acquired, it may be for a Union purpose or a \\nState purpose, or for any · other public purpose. \\nEntry 33 in List I (Union List) of the Seventh Schedule \\nto the Constitution speaks of acquisition or requisition-\\ning of property for the purposes of the Union. When \\nwe come to entry 42 of List III (Concurrent List), we \\nfind these words : \"Principles on which compensation \\nfor property acquired or requisitioned for the purposes 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nChandrasek_hara \\nAiyar f. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaia\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\ncf Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nChandrasekhara \\nAiyar f. 1008 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\nof the Union or of a State or for any other public pur-\\npose is to be determined, and the form and the manner \\nin which such compensation is to be given.\" \\nFrom very early times, law has recognized the right \\nof Government compulsorily to acquire private pro-\\nperties of individuals for a public purpose and this has \\ncome to be known as the law of eminent domain. \\nBut it is a principle of universal law that the acquisi-\\ntion can only be on payment of just compensation. \\nStory on the Constitution, Vol. 2, page 534, paragraph \\n.1790, has the following passage in discussing the con-\\ncluding clause of the Fifth Amendment of the American \\nConstitution : \\n. \"The concluding clause is that private property \\nshall not be taken for public use witltout just compen-\\nsation. This is an affirmance . of a great doctrine esta-\\nblished by the common law for the protection of \\nprivate property. It is founded in natural equity, \\nand is laid down by jurists as a principle of universal \\nlaw. Indeed, in a free government, almost all \\nother rights would become utterly worthless, if \\nthe Government possessed an uncontrollable power \\nover the private fortune of every citizen. One of \\nthe fundamental objects of every good government \\nmust be the due administration of justice ; and how \\nvain it would be to speak of such an administration, \\nwhen all property is subject to the will or caprice of \\nthe legislature and the rulers.\" \\nThe payment of compensation is an essential ele-\\nment of the valid exercise of the power to take. In the \\nleading case of Attorney-General v. De Keyser\\' s Royal \\nHotel, Ltd. (\\') Lord Dunedin spoke of the payment of \\ncompensation as a necessary concomitant to the tak-\\ning of property. Bowen L. J. said in London and North \\nWe~tern Ry. Co. v. Evans (\\') :-\\n\"The Legislature cannot fairly be supposed to in-\\ntend, in the absence of clear words showing such \\nintention, that one man\\'s property shall be confiscated \\nfor the benefit of others, or of the public, without any \\n(1) [1920] A.C. p. 508.

Parliament in \\nits omnipotence can, of course, override or disregard \\nthis ordinary principle ...... if it sees fit to do so, but it \\nis not likely that it will be found disregarding it, \\nwithout plain expres1sions of such a purpose.\" \\nThis principle is embodied in article 31 (2) of our \\nConstitution in these terms :-\\n\"~o prop_erty, i:iovable or immovaJ:le, including \\nany mterest m, or m any company ownmg, any com-\\nmercial or industrial undertaking, shall be taken pos-\\nsession of or acquired for public purposes under any \\nlaw authorising the taking of such possession or such \\nacquisition, unless the law provides for compensation \\nfor the property taken possession of or acquired and \\neither fixes the amount of the compensation, or \\nspecifies the principles on which, and the manner in \\nwhich, the compensation JS to be determined and \\ngiven.\" \\nWe shall not here trouble ourselves with sub-clauses \\n(3) and (4) of the article and with articles 31-A and \\n31-B which were introduced by way of amendment \\nunder the Constitution First Amendment Act, 1951, \\ndated 18-6-1951. They will be considered later. \\nThe argument of Shri P. R. Das that the payment \\nof compensation is a concomitant obligation to the \\ncompulsory acquisition of properties by the State can \\nbe accepted as sound ; but when he went further and \\nurged that it was found in an implicit form in entry 42 \\nof the Concurrent List, he was by no means on sure \\nground. The entries give us the bare heads of legisla-\\ntion. For ascertairU,ng the scope or extent or ambit of \\nthe legislation and the rights and the duties created \\nthereby, we must . examine the legislation itsdf or \\nmust have resort to general and well-recognized \\nprinciples of law of jurisprudence. No resort can be \\nhad to anything implicit or hidden when the statute \\nmakes an express provision on the same subject. As \\njust compensation has to be paid when property is \\nacquired for a public purpose, the legislation has to 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nChandrasekhara \\nAiyar /. 1952 \\nThe State of \\nBihar \\nv. \\nMaharaja\\xad\\ndhiraja Sir \\nKameshwar \\nSingh \\nof Darbhanga \\nand Others. \\nChandrasekhara \\nAiyar /. 1010 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] \\nformulate the principles for determining the compen-\\nsation and the form and the manner in which it is ·to \\nbe given. Entry 42 means nothing more than a \\npower conferred on the Legislature for achieving this \\nend. The power is conferred but there is no duty \\ncast to provide for compensation. For any statement \\nthat the payment of compensation is a primary condi-\\ntion for acquisition of property for a public purpose, \\nwe have to look at the provisions of the Constitution \\nitself and this we find in article 31(2) as stated \\nalready. Mr. Das was obliged to take up the unten-\\nable position that entry 42 of its own force implies \\nan obligation to pay compensation, as he could not \\notberwi:;e jump over the hurdles created in his way by · \\nsub-sections (3) and (4) of article 31 and the new \\narticles 31-A and 31-B. \\nThe learned Attorney-General contended in dealing \\nwith entry 42 that legislation under entry 42 can also \\nlay down principles that would lead to the non-pay- .• \\nment of any compensation and he cited Atiqa \\nBegum\\'s case(\\') as an authority in his support. This \\ncontention appears to me to be as unsound as \\nMr. Das\\'s argument that the obligation to pay or give \\ncompensation was implicit in the. said entry. As there \\ncan be no acquisition without compensation, th\\'e terms \\nof entry 42 enable the legislature to lay down the \\nprinciples and provide further for the form and . \\nmanner of payment. If the principles are so formu~ \\nlated as to result in non-payment altogether, then \\nthe legislature would be evading the law not only covert-\\nly but flagrantly. There is nothing in Atiqa Begum\\'s \\ncase that supports the argument. It was there hefd\\' \\nthat under the head \"payment of rent\" there could be \\nlegislation· providing for remission of rent. Payment \\nof rent is not a legal obligation of every tenure and the · ~ \\nlegislature can enact that under certain circumstances \\n.or conditions there shall be remission of rent. But as· \\n.regards compensation foi State acqu1S1t:lon, its pay- .. \\n. ment is a primary requisite universally recognized by )\"\": \\nlaw~ · This is the essential distinction to remember \\n(!) [1940] F.C.R. 110. • \\n, S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1011 \\nwhen we seek to apply the case quoted. The last words \\nin entry 42 \"form and the manner in which such \\ncompensation is to be given\" clearly mean that the \\nprinciples determining compensation must lead to the \\ngiving or payment of some <:01npensation. To negate \\ncompensation altogether by the enunciation of principles. \\nleading to such a result would be to contradict the \\nvery terms of the entry and such a meaning could not \\nbe attributed to the framers of the Lists. \\nThis, however, does not carry Shri P. R. Das any-\\nwhere near success. Article 31 ( 4) is the first stumbling \\nblock in· his way. It provides :-\\n\"If any Bill pending at the commencement of this \\nConstitution in the Legislature of a State has, after it \\nhas been passed by such Legislature, beert reserved for \\nthe consideration of the President and has received \\nhis assent, then, notwithstanding anything m this \\nConstitution, the law so assented to shall not be called \\nin question in any court on the ground that it contra-\\nvenes the provisions of clause (2).\" \\nThe Bill which subsequently became \"The Bihar \\nLand Reforms Act, 1950\" was pending at the com-\\nmencement of the Constitution in the legislature of \\nthe State, and after it was passed by the legislature, \\nit was reserved for the consideration of the President \\nand received his assent. Therefore the bar that it \\nshall not be called in question in any court on the \\nground that it contravenes the provisions of clause (2) \\nbecomes applicable. True, compensation has to be \\nprovided for, by reason of sub-clause (2) of the article, \\nbut sub-clause ( 4) postulates an exception and the \\nright to challenge the validity of the Act on the ground \\nthat no compensation has been provided for or that the \\ncompensation is really illusory or inadequate ts taken \\naway. As if this were not enough, two more stiles have \\nbeen erected in his way and they are the new articles \\n31-A and 31-B brought in by way of amendment. \\nArticle 31-A, sub-clause (1) is in these terms;:-\\n\"Notwithstanding anything m the foregoing \\nprovisions of this Part, no law providing for the \\n10~!0 S.C.

Under the Land Acquisition Act, I of 1894, \\na declaration by · the Government that land is needed \\nfor a public purpose shall be conclusive evidence that \\nthe land· is so needed and Courts cannot go into the \\nquestion whether the public purpose has been made \\nout or not. There is no such provision in any article \\nof the Constitution with which we have to deal. It is \\ntrue that sub-clause (2) of article 31 speaks of pro-\\nperty being acquired for public purposes. The bar \\ncreated by sub-clause ( 4) of article 31 relates to the \\ncontravention of the provisions of clause (2). The \\nprovision of clause (2) is only as regards compen-\\nsation as can be gathered from its latter part :-\\n\"Unless the law provides \\'for · compensation for \\nthe property taken possession of or acquired and either \\nfixes the amount of the compensation, or specifies the \\nprinciples on which, and the manner in which, the \\ncompensation is to be determined and given.\" \\nIt is assumed, rightly, that the existence of a public \\npurpose is · part and parcel of · the law and is inherent \\nin it. The existence of a public purpose is not a pro-\\nVlSlOn or condition imposed by article 31 (2) as a \\nlimitation on the exercise of the power of acquisition. \\nThe condition prescribed is only as regards compen~ \\nsation. Article 31 ( 4) debars the challenge of the con-\\nstitution.ality of an Act on this ground but no other. \\nWhether there is any public purpose at all, or whe-\\nther the purpose stated is such a purpose is open, in \\nmy opinion, to judicial scrutiny or review. \\nWhen the legislattire declares that there is a public \\npurpose behind the legislation, we have of course to \\nrespect its words. · The object of the Act in question \\nis to extinguish the interests of intermediaries like \\nzamindars, proprietors, and estate and tenure-holders \\netc., and to bring the actual cultivators into direct \\nrelations with the State Government.

It is impos.•iblc \\nto deny that the Act is inspired and dominated by a \\npublic purpose, but the question still remains whether \\nthe taking over of particular items can be said to be for \\na public purpose. It is in thi~ connection that the two \\nitems of \"arrears of rent\" and \"cost of works of benefit \\nto the raiyats\" dealt with in section 4, clause (b), and \\nsection 23, clause ( f), respectively of the Act, have to \\nbe considered. \\nThe taking over of \"arrears of rent\" does not seem \\nto have even a remote connection with any question of \\nland reform. It stands on no better footing than if \\nthe Act sought to take over the cash on hand or in \\nthe banks of the zamindars, proprietors or tenure-\\nholders. It is only an accident that the rents in ques-\\ntion were not realised before the passing of the Act. \\nWhether realised or not, they are his moneys due and \\npayable to him by the ryots.

Arrears of rent stand on no better \\nfooting. Any public purpose in taking them over is \\nconspicuous by its absence.

Taken either way, it is difficult to \\nsee wherein the public purpose consists. Whether \\nmoneys could be compulsorily acquired at all by a \\nState is a moot question. Willis say!l in his Constitu-\\ntional Law at page 816:-\"While, as stated above, \\nany and all property is in general subject to the exer-\\ncise of the power of eminent domain, there are certain \\nrather unusual forms of private property which can-\\nnot thus be taken.

The contract was for a term of 25 years. \\nWhen the merger took place, the city of Brooklyn \\nwas given power to purchase or to condemn the \\nproperty of the company within 2 years but it did \\nneither. In 1892, the legislature passed another Act \\nauthorising the City of Brooklyn to condemn the \\nproperty of the company, provided the necessary \\nproceedings were commenced within one year after \\nthe passing of the Act. The procedure for the acqui-\\nsition was prescribed in the Act itself. The power \\nwas exercised by the city and the compensation pay-\\nable was determined by the Commissioners at a parti-\\ncular figure. The company objected to the acquisi-\\ntion on the strength of article l, Paragraph 10, of the \\nU. S.

On error, the Supreme \\nCourt confirmed the condemnation and rejected \\nthe argument that there was any impairment of \\nthe contract. Mr. Justice Brewer points out that \\nthe contract is a mere incident to the tangible property \\nand that it is the later which, being fitted for public \\nuses, is condemned. The contract is not the thing \\nwhich is sought to be condemned and its impairment, \\nif impairment there be, is a mere consequence of the \\nappropriation of the tangible property.

Choses \\nin action unrelated to any tangible property can be \\nuseful for a public purpose only when converted into \\nmoney. Arrears of money are particularly so.

The Judgment of the Court was \\ndelivered by \\nWanehoo/. WANCHOO J.-This is an appeal by special leave \\nagainst the award of the Industrial Tribunal, Bombay, \\nin a dispute between the Tata Oil Mills Co. Ltd., \\nBombay (hereinafter !\"eferred to as the company) \\nand its workmen, in the matter of profit bonus (or the \\nyear 1955-56. The dispute arose over a demand made \\nby the workmen for payment unconditionally as bonus \\nfor the year 1955-56 of a sum equivalent to four \\nmonths\\' wages/salary for all employees drawing \\nwages/salary of less than Rs. 500 per mensem. This \\ndispute was referred to the Industrial Tribunal by the \\nGovernment of Bombay by its order dated June 18, \\n1957. The company had already paid 2! months\\' \\nbasic wages as bonus to its workmen and the real \\ndispute was thus only about the remaining bonus for \\na month and half. \\' \\' S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 3 \\nThe ease of the workmen was that the company had z959 \\nf made record profits during the year and declared a -\\ndividend of 12 per centum free of income-tax1 the The Tata Oil Milli \\nworkmen were getting much less than the living wage Co •• Ltd. \\nand the dearness allowance was not sufficient to fill the Its wor~;,,en and \\ngap, and, therefore, profit bonus at the rate of four Others \\nmonths\\' basic wages should be granted. The company, \\non the other hand, contended that it was paying Wanchoo 1; \\ngraded scale of wages with annual and biennial \\n~ increments and had already paid profit bonus for 2~\\xad\\nmonths. It was not possible for the company to pay \\nmore than that as bonus. as the available surplus \\naccording to the Full Bench formula did not justify it. \\nIt was also pointed out that thobgh the company \\nstarted as far back as 1917, the shareholders began to \\nget dividends only from 1940, and, therefore, a dividend \\nof 12 per centum free of income-tax was in the circum\\xad\\nstances not high. The company also claimed that in \\n<( making calculations for the purposes of the Full Bench. \\nformula certain items of extraneous income should not \\nbe taken into account. Next it claimed that a profit \\nof Rs. 3 lacs appearing in the accounts due to the \\nchange in the method of valuation was no real profit \\ndue to the efforts of labour and should not be taken \\ninto account in arriving at the available surplus. \\nLastly, it also claimed that it was entitled to 4 per \\ncentum interest on the working capital, including the \\na.mount in the depreciation fund. \\nThe Industrial Tribunal disallowed the claim of the \\ncompany on all these three points and after making \\nrelevant calculations came to the conclusion that there \\nwas a sufficient surplus available to permit the grant \\nof bonus for 3l months calculated on basic wages and1 \\ntherefore awarded the same. The company thereupon \\napplied for special leave to appeal, which was granted; \\nand that is how the matter has now come up before \\nus for decision. \\nWe shall first take the question of extraneous in\\xad\\ncome. Six items were sought to be excluded by the \\ncompany as extraneous income, and they were these : 4 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] \\nI959 \\nTht Tata Oil llfills \\nCo., Ltd. \\nv. \\nIts Worhn1tn and \\nOthers \\nU1anchoo ].

Learned counsel for \\nthe rcspondent,s appearing before us has stated that \\nthe claim with respect to items (iv) and (v) was con\\xad\\nceded bv the workmen before the Tribunal and it \\nseems t.Jiat by over-sight these items were not excluded \\nby it.. He .fairly concedes that these two items may be \\nexcluded from consideration in making calculations \\nfor arriving at the available surplus. We are thus left \\nwith four items, which were disallowed by the Tribunal. \\nThe reason given by the Tribunal for disallowing these \\nitems was that they formed part of the profits earned \\nin the course of the company\\'s business .and there was \\nno goocl reason for deducting them from the profits. It \\nfurther \\\\milt on to say that <lS regards income earned \\nby way of rent. light and power it was not disputed \\nthat expenditure in respect of buildings from which the \\nrent was derived, such as on rep<>irs and maintenance, \\nis iuclnded in the expenditure 8ide of the account, and \\ntaxes and rates for these buildings were paid by the \\ncompany. There was thus no reason for deducting \\nthis amount from the profits. It did not consider the \\' S.C.R. SUPREME COUR\\'f REPORTS 5 \\nother three items specifically and was content to z959 \\ninclude them on the general ground that they were The T ~a M\"ll \\nprofits earned in the course of the company\\'s business. ~~~.Ltd. \\' s \\nMr. Daphtary appearing for the company has drawn v. \\nour attention to a number of cases decided by indus- Its Workmen and \\ntrial tribunals as well as labour appellate tribunals, Others \\nwhere such items of income have been excluded on wanchoo J. \\nthe ground that they are extraneous income unrelated \\nto the efforts of the workmen. \\\\Ve do not think it \\n{ necessary to refer to all these decisions and it is suf\\xad\\nficient to say that these decisions support the conten\\xad\\ntion put forward. The main reason given in these \\ndecisions for excluding what is termed as extraneous \\nincome is that they are unrelated t.o the efforts of \\nworkmen. \\\\Ve may refer only to two of these decisions \\nof the labour appellate tribunal in this connection. In \\nThe Mill-Owners\\' Association, Bombay v. The Rashtriya \\n,j Mill .Mazdoor Sangh, Bombay (1) in which the ]\\'ull \\nBench formula was evolved, the appellate tribunal \\nrernal\\'ked at page 1257: \\n\" No scheme of allocation of bonus could be \\ncomplete if the amount out of which a bonus is to be \\npaid is unrelated to employees\\' efforts.\" \\nThe Appellate Tribunal reiterated this in Shalimar \\nRO\\'pe Works Mazdoor Union, How1·ah v. Messrs. Shali\\xad\\nmar Rope Works Ltd., Shalimar, Howrah(2) by observ\\xad\\ning at page 372 that \" it is however too late in the \\nday to question tlie view that there are profits un-\\n~ related to workers\\' efforts and referred to as \\'extraneous \\nprofits\\' and that such profits must be left out of \\naccount in deciding the question whether there is \\navailable surplus in any particular year.\" Income \\nreceived by way of rent of quarters and by sale of \\nscrap-materials has generally been treated as extra\\xad\\nneous income by the industrial tribunals on the basis \\nof these decisions of the Labour Appellate Tribunal. \\nIt is the correctness of this view which has been can-\\n1 vassed before us in this appeal. Reliance has also \\nbeen placed by some tribunals on the decision of this \\nCourt in Muir Mills Co. Ltd. v. Suti Mills Mazdoor \\n(1) 1950 L,L.J, U47.

This Court \\nT\\' T --0.1 M. observed at page 998 as follows: nt ala i ills \\nco., Ltd. \"There arc however two conditions which have \\nv. to be satisfied before a demand for bonus can be justifi-\\n11\\' Wo,kmw and ed, and they are, (1) when wages fall short of the \\nOthm living standard and (2) the industry makes huge pro-\\nWanchoo .f. fits part of which are due to the contribution which \\nthe workmen make in increasing production.\" \\nIt was fort.lier observed at page 999-\\n\"lt is therefore cle.ar that the claim for bonus \\ncan be made by the employees only if as n result of \\nthe joint contribution of capital and labour the indus\\xad\\nt.rinl concern has earned profits. If in any particular \\nyear the working of the industrial concern has resulted \\nin loss t.hnre is no basis nor justification for n demand \\nfor bonus.,. , \\nH is clettr from these observations that this Court \\nwas not de>tling with the question of extraneous income • \\nas such in the 1l!uir 1lfills Case (1). The principles laid \\ndown in that case show that there must be profits in \\nthe particular year for which bonus is claimed, result\\xad\\ning in nn available smplus before profit bonus can be \\nawarded. It is only when profits are made that \\nprofit bonus can be 11w1trded, subject to two further \\nconditions, n:i,mely, (1) W>tges fall short of the living \\nstandard and (2) the industry makes large profits part \\nof which are duo to the contribution which the work\\xad\\nmen make in produrtion. It is this last condition \\nwhich seems to have been relied upon by industrial • \\ntribunals in holding that there must be direct ctmnec\\xad\\ntion hetween the efforts of labour and the profits, and \\nunless that direct connection is established the profits \\nmust be treated as unrelated to the efforts of labour \\nand thus become extraneous income. There is no \\ndoubt that there must be contribution of the workmen \\nin earning profits before they are entitled to profit \\nbonus; but it wa.s not laid down in the Muir Mills \\\\ Case(\\') that direct connection between the efforts of the \\nworkmen and the particular item of profit earned must \\nbe established before the profit can be taken into \\naccount for the purposes of arriving at the available \\n(1) 1955 (1) S.C.R. 991. , • S.C.R. SUPREME UOURT REPORTS 7 \\nsurplus. An industrial concern carries on a certain r959 \\nbusiness. In carrying on that business it employs Th T Oil M\\'ll \\ncapita.I as well as labour, and generally speaking the 8 \\n~;~ Ltd. • s \\nprofits earned in the normal course of business at t4e v. \\nend of year are the result of the joint effort of capital Its Workmen and \\nand labour. Even so, it may be recognized that there Others \\nmay be instauees of extraneous income for the pur\\xad\\npose of the ]\\'ull Bench formula due (i) either to some \\npart of the profits not having bee°t earned in that year, \\n(ii) or to some part of profits arising out of fortuitous \\ncircumstances altogether unconnected with the efforts \\nof labour. A third category may be the income \\narising out of sale of fixed or capital assets. Such \\nincome or profit may be called extraneous income as \\neither it did not really arise in that year or though it \\nhas arisen in that year, labour has not contributed \\nanything towards its accrual ; it may therefore not be \\ntaken into account in calculations according to the \\nFull Bench formula. But apart from these cases, we \\ncannot see how income arising during the year in the \\nnormal course of business of the concern can be called \\nextraneous income merely on the ground that no direct \\nconnection between the efforts of labour and the \\naccrual of the income has been established. In this \\nvery case we find an instance of the first category in \\ntwo items relating to return of excess provision for \\nexpenses and refund of excess profits tax. These two \\namounts have gone to swell the profits of this year; \\nhut they have not arisen in this year and may, there-\\nfore, properly be treated as extraneous income. An \\ninstance of the second kind is to be found in the profit \\nof Rs. 3 lacs made in this year by a change in the \\nmethod of valuation of the company\\'s assets, which is \\nentirely unconnected with the efforts of labour. But so \\nfar as the other four items are concerned, they are \\nearned by the company in the normal course of its \\nbusiness and there is no reason why they should be \\nexcluded on the ground that it has not been proved \\nthat they are the result of direct efforts of labour in \\nthis year. \\nLet us take these four items one by one. The first \\nis the item of income earned by way of rent, light and Wanchoo ]. 8 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] \\nx959 power. It is well known that many industrial concerns \\n\\'1 he Tata Oil Mills provide amenities for their workmen by building \\nco., Ltd. quarters, which are provided with light and power \\nv. from the concern\\'s power house. The quarters and, \\nIts Workmen and power-house are built out of capital or profits earned \\nOthers in past years. If they are built out of ca pita!, there is \\nwanchoo J. provision for a return which is generally at 6 per \\ncentum on the paid-up capital. Even if they are \\nbuilt out of past prpfits, the depreciation and rehabili\\xad\\ntation charges fall on the gross profits before the \\navailable surplus is arrived at. Besides, expenditure \\nwith regard to repairs and maintenance, and rates and \\ntaxes is all paid out of the income of the concern \\nbefore the gross profits are arrived at. In other words \\nthese expenses are paid out of the profits in the earning \\n· of which the workmen have contributed their labour. \\nHow can the company claim to exclude the rent etc., \\nfrom the profits while meeting the expenditure relating \\nto such assets out of the profits, part of which is \\natt.ributable to the efforts of labour? In short, income \\nby way of rent, light and power arises in the normal \\ncourse of business of the concern and there is no reason \\nwhy a direct contribution by labour during the year \\nin question must be insisted upon in the case of such \\nincome. The company must also be employing some \\nlabour for purposes of maintenance and repairs of the \\nquarters aud power-house, even though the labour \\nmay not be wholly allocated to this work only. We \\nare, therefore, of opinion that income from rent, light \\nand power arises in the normal course of business of a \\nconcern and cannot be treated as extraneous income in \\nthe sense described above. \\nThe next item is estate revenue. We are told that \\nthe company has coconut groves, which produce \\ncoconuts used in preparing oil which is one of the \\nmain items of the company\\'s business. We are also \\ntold that sometimes the entire produce of these groves \\nis not used in the manufacture of oil and therefore \\nsome part of the produce is sold. This income is out \\nof this part sold in the market. Here again the income \\narises in the normal course of business and the expenses \\nfor looking after and maintaining the groves are paid 1 \\n• S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 9 \\nby the company and entered into its account. The z959 \\ncompany must also be employing labour to look after The Tata Oil Mills \\nthe groves. In these circumstances we fail to see why co., Ltd. \\nthis income by sale of surplus coconuts should be v. \\nexcluded from the profits for the purpose of the Full Its Workmen anrl \\nBench formula. Others \\nThen we come to the profit on sale of empty barrels WanchooJ. and sale proceeds of tin cans, scraps, logs, planks, \\ngunnies etc. These items may be taken together, for \\nthe nature of the receipt is the same, though on account \\nof the method of accounting employed, the income in \\nthe case of barrels is shown as profit while in the case \\nof scrnps etc., it is shown as sale proceeds. It is said \\nthat this is extraneous income because it is unrelated \\nto the efforts of labour. We cannot accept this con-\\ntention, for this income again is in the normal course \\nof business. Further when the company buys chemi-\\ncals (for example), it pays for the chemicals as well \\nas the containers, namely, the barrels. When the \\nchemicals are used up these empty barrels are sold. \\nWhatever is the income from the sale of these barrels \\nis in reality a reduction in the cost price of chemicals \\nto the company, though by the method of accounting \\nemployed it may appear as profit on the sale of \\nbarrels. We see no reason why the reduction in cost \\nprice of chemicals should not be taken into account for \\nthe purpose of arriving at gross profits in making \\ncalculations for the Full Bench formula. Some scraps \\nare normally left over in the process of manufacture. \\nWhatever income is derived from such scraps also \\ngoes to reduce the cost price of materials used in \\nproduction and thus to increase the profits. We do not \\nsee why this income arising in the normal course of the \\ncompany\\'s business should not be taken into account \\non the plea that labour has not directly contributed in \\nits accrual. We are, therefor<\\\\ of opinion that all these \\nfour items were rightly taken into account by the \\nTribunal in arriving at the gross profits. \\nThen we come to the profit of Rs. 3 lacs made by a \\nchange in the method of accounting. The Tribunal \\ndid not accept this income as extraneous and in so \\ndoing it fell into error. This income of Rs. 3 lacs has \\n2 10 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] \\n\\'959 nothing whatsoever to do with the efforts of labour, \\nTh T -Oil M\\'ll even though it has arisen this year. It has arisen out \\ne ala • s f .c t \"t , t . h th\\' co .. Ltd. o a ior m ous circums ance masmuc as is year \\nv. there was a change in the basis of valuation of stock. \\nIts Workmen and It is not income in the normal course of business, \\nOthers because it is not likely to arise ever again. In the \\nWanchooj, circumstances this income of Rs. 3 lacs must be treated \\nas extraneous income and excluded for the purpose of \\ncalculations based on the Full Bench formula. \\nThe last item with which we are concerned is the \\nreturn on the amount of depreciation reserve used as \\nworking capital. An affidavit was made on behalf of \\nthe company that it had used its reserve funds com\\xad\\nprising premium on ordinary shares, general reserve, \\ndepreciation reserve, workmen\\'s compensation reserve, \\nemployees\\' gratuity reserve, bad and doubtful debt \\nreserves and sales promotion reserve as working \\ncapital. The Tribunal, however, allowed return at 4 \\nper centum on a working capital of Rs. 31·88 lacs. \\nThis excluded the depreciation reserve but included all \\nother reserves which were claimed by the company \\nand having been used for working capital. The Tribu\\xad\\nnal gave no reason why it excluded the amount of the \\ndepreciatiGn reserve in arriving at the figure of work\\xad\\ning capital. A return is allowed on the reserves used \\nas working capital on the ground that if these reserves \\nare not used for this purpose, the concern would have \\nto borrow money and pay interest on that. This being \\nthe basis on which a return on reserves used as work\\xad\\ning capital is allowed, there is no reason why, if there \\nis in fact money available in the depreciation reserve \\nand if that money is actually used during the year as \\nworking capital, a return should not be allowed on \\nsuch money also. Further if the money has been con\\xad\\nverted into such assets as stock in trade and stores \\netc., (i.e., other than capital or fixed assets), it will be \\nobviously available from year to year to that extent as \\n. working capital subject to adjustments on account of \\nloans, secured or otherwise. Learned counsd for the \\nrespondents wanted to contest that the whole amount \\nin the depreciation reserve was not available for being \\nused as working capital. It is enough to say that the S.C.R. SUPREME ·coURT REPORTS 11 \\naffidavit of the Chief Accountant filed on behalf of the z959 \\nco~pany was not challenged before the Industrial The Tata Oil Mills \\nTribunal on behalf of the respondents. It would, co., Ltd. \\ntherefore, be impossible for us now to over-look that v. \\naffidavit, particularly when the Tribunal gave no Its Workmen and \\nreason why it treated the working capital as Rs. 31·88 Others \\nlacs only. So far therefore as the present year is con- Wamhoof. \\ncerned, we must accept the affidavit and hold that the \\nworking capital was Rs. 139·09 lacs. It will, however, \\nbe open to the workmen in future to show by proper \\ncross-examination of the company\\'s witnesses or by \\nproper evidence that the amount shown as the depre-\\nciation reserve was not available in whole or in part \\nto be used as working capital and that whatever may \\nbe available was not in fact so used in the sense \\nexplained above. In the present appeal, however, we \\nmust accept the affidavit of the Chief Accountant. The \\nTribunal allowed 4 per centum interest on the working \\n0apital and that must be allowed on the total sum of \\nRs. 139·09 lacs. \\nWe now come to the calculations in accordance with \\nthe Full Bench formula, subject to what we have said \\nabove: \\nProfit for th.-. year ... \\nAdd provision for -Rs. in lacs Rs. in lacs \\n15•53 \\n(i) tax ........................... . \\n(ii) depreciation .............. . 14•51 \\n11•75 \\n(iii) bonus ........................ . 7•76 34·02 \\nGross Profits. \\nLess extraneous income \\nBalance ................. . \\nLess notional normal depreciation \\nBalance ................. . \\nLess income-tax payable a.ocording to \\nMeenakshi Mills case (1) (PCT Note A \\nBelow). \\nBalance ...• ...,,. .......... . 49·55 \\n3·80 \\n45·75 \\n11·12 \\n34•63 \\n15•90 \\nJ.8·73 \\'959 \\nThe Tata Oil Mills \\nCo., Ltd. \\nv. \\nIts Worknien and \\nOthers \\nivanchoo j. 12 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)) \\nRs. in lacs Rs. in lacs \\nLess dividend on paid-up 5•54 \\ncapital \\nLess return on Reserves used 5•56 \\nas working capital of Rs. \\n139·09 @ Rs. 4 per cent. \\nU·lO \\nAvailable surplus 7•63 \\nLess bonus actually paid 7·90 \\nLess rebate of income-tax at 3•40 \\n-/7/-in the rupee .. 4•50 \\nAmount remaining with the Company..... 3·13 \\nNote A. \\nGross Profits \\nLess total statutory \\ndepreciation Rs. in lacs \\n49•55 \\n13·19 \\nBalance...... 36·36 \\nIncome-tax at -/7/-in 15·90 \\na rupee \\nThe available surplus· of profit thus works out at \\nRs. 7·63 lacs.

The company would be entitled to a rebate \\nof Rs. 3·40 lacs on this sum and therefore the amount \\nwhich the company has actually to pay is Rs. 4·50 \\nlacs. This will leave a sum of Rs. 3·13 lacs out of the \\navailable surplus with the company for its use. It will \\nbe seen that more than half the available surplus has \\nalready gone to labour according to what the company \\nhas paid. There are three sharers in the available \\nsurplus, namely, the industry, share-holders and \\nlabour. In the circumstances no case has been made \\nout for increasing the profit bonus beyond what the • \\n• \\ncompany has already paid, particularly when we find i \\nthat the company has claimed no rehabilitation \\ncharges in this year.

Its business was \\nmainly that of carrying on public transport on Route \\nNo. 14 in the City of Calcutta, as also of dealers in \\nand repairers of motor vehicles. It had an authorized \\ncapital of six lacs of rupees divided into 600 shares of \\nRs. 1,000 each, out of \\'which, shares worth Rs. 4,00,000 \\nonly had been subscribed and paid up.

The Court, \\nby its order dated September 8, 1954, directed the \\nLiquidators to pay within a week the arrears of salary \\nof all the workmen, and also within a week from \\nreceiving sale proceeds of the auction-sale aforesaid, to \\npay the workers, in lieu of notice, one week\\'s wages to \\nweekly paid workmen, two weeks\\' wages to fortnightly \\npaid workmen, and one month\\'s wages to monthly paid \\nworkmen. The Directors were to hold the balance of \\nthe sale proceeds till further orders of the Court. \\nIt will be noticed from the order of reference, quoted \\nabove, that besides the Official Liquidators, the second \\nappellant was also impleaded as a party to the Refe\\xad\\nrence, in his capacity as the auction-purchaser of the \\nCompany.

The Tribunal awarded, \\ninter alia, compensation under section 25(F)(b) of the \\nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947, and directed the Com\\xad\\npany to pay compensation, within two months from \\nthe date the award became enforceable, to such of the \\nworkmen as had been found entitled to the same. It \\nmay be noted here that the proceedings before the \\nIndustrial Tribunal had commenced without the \\nnecessary sanction of the High Court in the liquida\\xad\\ntion proceedings, but during the pendency of the \\nproceedings, the High Court, by its order dated Decem\\xad\\nber 20, 1955, granted leave to the workmen to proceed \\nwith and continue the proceedings against the Official \\nLiquidators of the Company. The Industrial Tribunal, \\ntherefore. further direetcd that so far as the Liquida\\xad\\ntors were concPrnt>d, t,he compensation awarded to the \\nworkmen \\'\\' shall be recoverable only out of the assets \\nin their hands according to law ;\\'. So far as the \\nauction-purchaser was concerned, the award proceed\\xad\\ned to make further directions in these terms : \\n\"The auction-purchaser, it has already been \\nnoted, purchased the different sections of the business \\nwith the name \" The Great Indian Motor Works \" \\nfree from encumbrances and all outgoings and liabili\\xad\\nties (Vide Exts.

Hence I agree \\nwith the learned Advocate of the auction-purchaser \\nthat the rMerence so far as the auction-purchaser is \\nconcerned is incompetent. Apart from that, when the \\nauction-purchaser purchased the business free from \\nencumbrances and all outgoings and liabilities and \\nwhen there is nothing to show that the auction-pur-\\nchaser undertook at any time to maintain the old staff \\nin his service, it cannot be said that his refusal to \\ncontinue the employment of 142 employees was un-\\njustified. Only when one purchases with all assets and \\nliabilities as a going concern, he is bound to continue \\nthe old employees in service and not otherwise. \\nI award accordingly.\" \\nAgainst the said Award which, in terms, was made \\nonly against the Liquidators and not against the \\nauction-purchaser aforesaid, only one of the two Liqui\\xad\\ndators, namely, Debendra Lall Dutt, made an applica\\xad\\ntion to the High Court for necessary directions regard\\xad\\ning preferring an appeal. The other Liquidator, Chandy \\nDas :Nundy, opposed the said application for leave to \\nappeal.

It is not necessary to set out the \\ngrounds of appeal in either of the two appeals, in view \\nof our decision on the preliminary question of the \\nmaintainability of the appeal in this Court, as will \\npresently appear. \\nThe Labour Appellate Tribunal disposed of the two \\nappeals by its order dated August 1, 1956. The appel\\xad\\nlants\\' appeal was dismissed as incompetent in view \\nof the provisions of s. 179 of Indian Companies Act, \\n1913, re-enacted as s. 457 of the Companies Act, \\n1956. The dismissal of the appeal on the ground of \\nthe appeal not being competent; was based on the \\norder of the Calcutta High Court, dated April 30, 1956, \\naforesaid, refusing leave to the Liquidators to prefer \\nan appeal. It is noteworthy that the appeal before \\nthe Appellate Tribunal, was not by the Liquidators \\nbut by K.D. N undy as Managing Director of the Com\\xad\\npany, as also by him in his capacity as the creditor or \\ncontributory or as the auction-purchaser of the Com\\xad\\npany. This aspect of the case has not been dealt with \\nby the Tribunal which held that the appeal was not \\nmaintainable as it was not authorised by the High \\nCourt. The employees\\' appeal also was dismissed as \\nit was not pressed in view of the fact that the appeal \\nby the Company stood dismissed t.s unauthorized. \\nlt was against the aforesaid order of the Appellate • \\n• S.C.R.

If that ur<lcr of Lhe Appellate ~rribunal is \\ncorrect, and if we Jiud that the appellants could not \\nhave any locn8 .stawli to prefer a.u appeal of their own \\nas distinct from that on behalf of the Company, no \\nother 4uesi,ion would <trise for determination in this \\ncase.

If there is \\nanything in those provisions of the Companies Act, \\ninconsistent with th\" provisious of the Act, the latter \\nshall prevail. Hence, we have to construe the provi\\xad\\nsions of s. 12 which specifically deals with appeals. \\nThat section permits an appeal to be presented to the \\nAppellate Tribunal by r,ny party which is aggrieved by \\nthe a ward (omitting the words not necessary for our \\npresent purpose). It is the usual statutory provision \\nfor an appeal, which otherwise would not lie. It does \\nnot say either in ex press terms or by necessary impli\\xad\\ncation, that those specific provisions of the Companies \\nAct, are abrogated or modified. It does not do away \\nwith the necessity of the requisite sanction of the Court \\nso far as a Liquidator is concerned. Under the provi\\xad\\nsions of the lndiau Companies Act, the affairs of the \\ncompany under liquidation, are placed in charge of the \\nOfficial Liquidator, and under s. 457, it is only the \\nLiquidator who is authorized with the sanction of the \\nCourt, to institute any suit or other legal proceedings \\nin the name and on behalf of the company. Thus, \\nthere is no inconsistency between the aforesaid provi\\xad\\nsions of the Act and the Companies Act, which only \\nlaid down a condition precedent to the filing of an \\nappeal, if it has to be, by a Liquidator of a company \\nin the process of winding up. It concerns a very \\nspecial case and has no bearing on the general right of \\nappeal. As, in the instant case, the Court refused the \\nnecessary sanction to the Liquidators to prefer the \\nappeal, no appeal could have been filed on behalf of \\nthe Company. Hence, in so far as the appeal purported \\nto be on behalf of the Compa11y, through the Managing • \\n• \" \\n-\\n• S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 23 \\nDirector aforesaid, it was wholly incompetent. But r959 \\nthe appeal was not only by the Company as such, but G 11 d\" \\nK D N d h d. . rea n ian also by the said . . un y as t e ere itor or contri- Motor Works Ltd., \\nbutory or auction-purchaser of the Company. So far and Another \\nas this part of the appeal is concerned, it is clear that v. \\nonly a pa.rty to the Reference aggrieved by the Award Their Employees · 1 1rnd Others could be a party to the appca. K .. D. Nundy was not a \\nParty in his c.bpacity as creditor or as contributorv. . s· h 1 . \"\\' a . He was impleaded, as already ir-iicated as a party to \\nthe Reference in his capacity as ;,fie auction-purchaser \\nof the business of the Company. So far as that capacity \\nis concerned, it is clear from the order of the Tribunal, \\nthat no award was made against him as such. He \\ncould not, therefore, be said to be a party aggrieved \\nby the award, having been exonerated from its terms. \\nThe Tribunal put this on three main grounds-(1) that \\nthe auction-purchaser had purchased the business of \\nthe Company free from all encumbrances, out-goings \\nand liabilities, (2) that tho employment of the work\\xad\\nmen had been terminated hy the Liquidators before \\npossession of the business was delivered to the auction\\xad\\npurchaser, and (3) that there was no relationship of \\nemployer and employees between the auction-purchaser \\nand the workmen whose services were so terminated. \\nThe Tribunal, in that view of the matter, declared \\nthe Reference to be incompetent in so far as the \\nauction-purchaser was concerned. Thi;;: order, the \\nTribunal passed at the instance of the auction\\xad\\npurchaser himself. Th0 auction-purclu1-ser, therefore, \\nsucceeded in obtaining the order which the Tribunal \\npassed, holding that the R<:\\'forence, so far as he was \\nconcerned, was incompetent. In view of these facts, \\nit must be held that so far as the auction-purchaser is \\nconcerned, he was not aggrieved by the Award made \\nby the Industrial Tribunal. That being so, the provi\\xad\\nsions of s. 12 of the Act, are not attracted to the appeal \\npurported to have been filed by the auction-purchaser. \\nIt is a little difficult to appreciate why the auction\\xad\\npurchaser, having succeeded in obtaining the order, set \\nout above, in his favour, changed his mind and prefer\\xad\\nred an appeal which, in the events that had happened, \\nwas not maintainable. 1959 \\nGreat Indian \\nMotor Works Ltd., \\nand A ·not her \\nv. \\nTheir E1nployees \\nand Others \\nSinha]. \\n1959 \\nJt,[ay6. \\'\\'\\\\. \\n24 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1960(1)] \\\\ \\nIn our opinion, therefore, the Labour Appellate \\nTribunal was not in error in dismissing the appeal by -1111 \\nthe Company and by the auction-purchaser, as in\\xad\\ncompetent.

The Judgment of the Court was \\ndelivered by. \\nWANCHOO J.-These are two connected appeals by \\nspecial leave against the decision of the Labour \\nAppellate Tribunal in an industrial matter. Appeal \\nNo. 473 is by Messrs. Ispahani Ltd. (hereinafter called \\nthe company) and appeal No. 4\\'.74 is by the employees \\nof the company represented by Ispahani Employees\\' \\nUnion (hereinafter called the workmen). They will \\nbe disposed of by one judgment. \\nThere was a dispute between the company and its \\nworkmen on a number of matters, which was referred \\nby the Government of West Bengal to the adjudica\\xad\\ntion of the Second Industrial Tribunal, by an order of \\nDecember 17, 1953. There were a number of matters \\nwhich had to be adjudicated upon ; but of these only \\ntwo now survive, namely-\\n(!) whether the workmen are entitled to puja \\nbonus for 1953, and \\n(2) whether the workmen are entit.led to receive \\nfrom the company any benefits for the period of \\nservice rendered by them under Messrs. llf. M. \\nIspahani Ltd. \\nA few facts may be set out here to give the back\\xad\\nground of this dispute. Originally, there was another \\ncompany called Messrs. M. M. Ispahani Ltd. which was \\ncarrying on business in Calcutta since December 1934 \\nbefore the partition of India. Shortly before the parti\\xad\\ntion took place, Messrs. M. M. Ispahani Ltd. trans\\xad\\nferred their registered head office from Calcutta to \\nChittagong, now in Pakistan. That company thus \\nbecame a Pakistani company after August 1947. It, \\nhowever, continued to own properties in India and \\ncarried on some business in Calcutta on a small scale. \\nThe company was incorporated on September 15, 1947 \\nand took over the good-will and trading rights of \\nMessrs. M. M. Ispahani Ltd. and also purchased the \\nstock-in-trade, properties and assets of that company. \\nMost of the shares of the company were, however, held \\nby Messrs. M. M. Ispahani Ltd. and the business of the \\ncompany was of the same nature and was carried on \\nin the same premises with the same telegraphic address • \\n• r \\nS.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 27 \\nand with the same workmen on thll same remunera\\xad\\ntion. Further, the company continued to pay puja \\nbonus at the rate of one month\\'s wages from 1948 up \\nto 1952. As no bonus was paid in 1953, a dispute \\narose between the company and the workmen, which \\nwas referred for adjudication along with other matters. \\nThe Industrial Tribunal held that it had not been \\nestablished that puja bonus had been paid at the \\nuniform rate of one month\\'s wages for a sufficiently \\nlong time and for unbroken period, and therefore \\nrejected the claim for puja bouns for 1953. On the \\nother question relating to whether the workmen were \\nentitled to receive from the company any benefits for \\nthe period of service rendered by them under Messrs. \\nM. 1\\\\1. Ispahani Ltd., it held that the workmen were \\nentitled to take into account the service rendered by \\nthem under Messrs. M. M. Ispahani Ltd. in the matter \\nof benefits due under the law during their service under \\nthe company. \\nThis award led to two appeals, one by the company \\non the question of benefits arising from the service \\nrendered under Messrs. M. M. Ispahani Ltd., and the \\nother by the workmen with respect to puja bonus for \\nthe year 1953. The Labour Appellate Tribunal allowed \\nboth the appeals. It held on the question of bonus \\nthat it had been proved that puja bonus had become a \\nterm of employment and the workmen were therefore \\nentitled to bonus at the rate of one month\\'s wages for \\nthe year 1953. As to the benefits arising out of the \\nservice rendered by the workmen under Messrs. M. M. \\nIspahani Ltd., it held that there was termination of \\nemployment of the workmen when Messrs. M. M. \\nIspahani migrated to Pakistan and the employment of \\nthe workmen by the company was fresh employment \\nand they therefore were not entitled to any benefits \\narising out of their employment under Messrs. M. M. \\nIspahani Ltd. Both the company and workmen applied \\nfor special leave to appeal to this Court against the \\ndecision of the Appellate Tribunal insofar as it was \\nagainst them. The applications were granted; and that \\nis how the matter has come up before us. I959 \\nJspahani Lid., \\nCalcutla \\nv. \\nlspahani \\nEmployees\\' Union \\nWanchoo ]. 28 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)~ \\n\\'959 We shall first take up the appeal of the company \\nrelating to pui·a bonus for the year 1953. Two points Ispahani Ltd .• \\nCalcutta have been urged in this behalf, namely-\\nv. (1) the Appellate Tribunal had no jurisdiction to \\n1.>pah~ni . interfere with the finding of the Industrial Tribunal as \\nEmploym Umon it was a finding of fact ; and \\nwanchoo J. (2) even ifthe Appellate Tribunal had jurisdiction, \\nits decision is incorrect in law. \\nPuja is a special festival in Bengal and it has become \\nusual with many firms there to give bonus before puja \\nto their workmen. This matter came up before the \\nAppellate Tribunal in Jtlahalaxmi Cotton Mills Ltd., \\nCafoutta v. Mahalaxmi Cotton Mills Worlcers\\' Union.(1) \\nIn that case puja bonus was claimed as a matter of \\nright payable by the employer at a special season of \\nthe year, namely, at the time of the annual Durga \\nPuja. \\'!\\'his right was not based on the general princi\\xad\\nple that labour and capital should share the surplus \\nprofits available after meeting prior charges. It was \\nheld in that case that this right rested on an agreement \\nbetween the employer and the employees, and that the \\nagreement might be either express or implied. Where \\nthe agreement was not express, circumstances might \\nlead the tribunal to an inference of implied agreement. \\nThe following cireumstances were laid down in that \\ncase as material for inferring an implied agreement:-\\n(1) The payment must be unbroken: \\n(2) lt must be for a sufficiently loug period; and \\n(3) The circumstances in which payment was \\nmade should be such as tu oxdude that it was paid out \\nof bounty. \\nThe Appellate Tribunal further pointed out that it was \\nnot possible to lay clown in tcrnrn wlmt should be the \\nlength of period to justify the inference of implie<l \\nagreement and that that would depend upon the cir\\xad\\ncumstances of each case. It also pointed out that the \\nfact of payment in a year of loss would he an impor\\xad\\ntant factor in excluding the hypothesis that the \\npayment was out of bounty and in coming to the \\nconclusion that it was as a matter of obligation based \\n(1) 1952 L.A. C. 370. • / \\n\" \\n\\'• I \\nI \\nS.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 29 \\non implied agreement. As to the quantum of bonus it r959 \\nwas laid down that even if payment was not at a Ispahani Ltd., \\nuniform rate throughout the period, the implied agree- Calcutta \\nment to pay something could be inferred and it would v. \\nbe for the tribunal to decide what was the reasonable Ispahani \\namount to be paid as puja bonus. The tests laid down Employees\\' Union \\nin that case have since been followed in a number of -Wanchoo ]. cases by the Industrial Tribunals and the Labour \\nAppellate Tribunal. \\\\Ve do not think it necessary to \\nrefer to all those cases. It may now be taken as well \\nsettled that puja bonus in Bengal stands on a different \\nfooting from the profit bonus based on the Full Bench \\nformula evolved in The M illowners\\' Association, Bombay \\nv. The Rashtriya .Mill Mazdoor Sangh, Bombay (1). The \\nclaim for puja bonus in Bengal is based on either of \\ntwo grounds. It may either be a matter of implied \\nagreement between employers and employees creating \\na term of employment for payment of puja bonus, or \\n(secondly) even though no implied agreement can be \\ninferred it may be payable as a customary bonus. In \\nthe present case we are concerned with the first cate-\\ngory, (namely, that based on an implied agreement \\ncreating a term of employment between the employer \\nand the employees), and so we shall confine ourselves \\nto that category. It was this kind of bonus which was \\nconsidered by the Appellate Tribunal in Mahalaxmi \\nCotton Mills case (2). We are of opinion that the tests \\nlaid down in that case for inferring that there was an \\n.implied agreement for grant of such a bonus are \\ncorrect and it is necessary that they should all be \\nsatisfied before bonus of this type can be granted. \\nThis brings us to the two questions raised on behalf \\nof the company, as set out above. The first question, \\n(namely, that the Appellate \\'rribunal had no jurisdic\\xad\\ntion to interfere with the finding of the Industrial \\nTribunal that begin a question of fact) can be easily \\ndisposed of. We are of opinion that the decision \\nwhether there is an implied term of employment is a \\nmixed question of fact and law and not a pure ques\\xad\\ntion of fact. This is similar to the decision, for \\nexample, on a question whether a custom has been \\n(1) i950 L.L.J. 1247 (2) 1952 L.A.C. 370 30 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)) \\nz959 established or whether adverse possession has been \\nProved, or whether a Hindu family has ceased to be Ispahani Led., \\nCalcutta joint as a matter of law accepting the facts proved. \\nv. The Appellate Tribunal will therefore have jurisdiction \\nIspahani to consider whether on the facts proved before the \\nEmployees\\' Union Industrial Tribunal an inference in law can be drawn \\nthat an implied term of employment for grant of Wanchoo ]. puja bonus has been established. The Appellate \\nTribunal therefore had jurisdiction to consider this \\nmatter. \\nThe next question is whether in law the decision of \\nthe Appellate Tribunal drawing the inference of an \\nimplied term of employment in this case is correct. \\nThe undisputed facts here are these : The workmen \\nwhen they were in the employ ofMessIB. M.M. Ispahani \\nLtd. always used to get puja bonus at the rate of one \\nmonth\\'s wages. This was asserted by the workmen in \\ntheir written statement and the company did not deny \\nit in its reply. All that it said was that the practice or \\ncustom prevalent at the time of Messrs. M.M. Ispahani \\nLtd. and the payment of bonus by that company were \\nimmaterial and did not bind the company. This aver\\xad\\nment impliedly admitted that Messrs. M. M. Ispahani \\nLtd. used to pay puja bonus as alleged by the respon\\xad\\ndents. The company practically took over the business \\nfrom Messrs. M.M. lspahani Ltd. and it was found that \\nit had been paying bonus ever since it came into exis\\xad\\ntence from 1948 right up to 1952 without any break \\nattherate of one month\\'s wages and that this bonus was \\npaid even in the years in which the company suffered \\nloss. In the circumstances, it was established in this \\ncase that (1) the payment was unbroken and (2) it was \\nnot paid out of bounty due to profits having arisen, \\nfor it was paid in some years of loss also. The only \\nother question that remains is whether it had been paid \\nfor a sufficiently long period in order to justify the \\ninference that it was an implied term of employment. \\nThe length of the period depends on the circumstances \\nof each case and what may be a short period not \\njustifying an inference of an implied term of employ\\xad\\nment in one case may be long enough in another. In \\nthe present case, sin<:e the appellant has paid the bonus •\\' \\n.. .. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 31 \\ncontinuously since its birth, we agree with the Appel\\xad\\nlate Tribunal that the circumstances justify the \\ninference of an implied term of employment for pay\\xad\\nment of puja bonus at the rate of one month\\'s wages \\nevery year. The appeal of the company must there\\xad\\nfore fail. \\nTurning now to the appeal of the workmen on the \\nquestion of benefits, we are of opinion that the decision \\nof the Appellate Tribunal on this question also is \\ncorrect. It is true that the company practically took \\nover the business of Messrs. M. M. Ispahani Ltd. But, \\nas pointed out by the Appellate Tribunal, when \\nMessrs. M. M. Ispahani Ltd. transferred their head\\xad\\noffice from Calcutta to Chittagong, the question arose \\nof retrenching those employees who were not willing \\nto go to Chittagong in view of the expected partition \\nof India. In these circumstances, the company, when \\nit came into existence in September 1947, agreed to \\nemploy those employees of Messrs. M. M. Ispahani Ltd., \\nwhose services were likely to be terminated. These \\nemployees apparently agreed to the termination of \\ntheir services with Messrs. M. M. Ispahani Ltd., and \\ntherefore obtained settlement of their claims for \\nprovident fund, and also received all arrears of salary \\nfrom them. They were thereafter appointed, after \\nwithdrawal of their provident fund, by the company. \\nThere was no express or implied undertaking given by \\nthe company regarding continuity of service and the \\nemployees joined the provident fund of the company \\nafresh. In the circumstances the decision of the \\nAppellate Tribunal on this question is correct, and the \\nappeal of the workmen must also fail. \\nWe therefore dismiss both the appeals and in con\\xad\\nsequence order the parties to bear their own costs of \\nthis Court. \\nAppeals dismissed .

The Judgment of the Court was \\ndelivered by \\nWANCHOO J.-This is an appeal by special leave in \\nan .industrial matt.er. The appellant is the Phulbari \\nTea Estate (hereinafter called the company). The \\ncase relates to the dismissal of one workman namely, \\nB. N. Das (hereinafter called Das), which had been \\ntaken up by the Assam Chah Karmchari Sangh, which \\nis a registered trade union. A reference was made by \\nthe Government of Assam on March 8, 1956, to the \\nIndustrial Tribunal on the question whether the dis-\\nmissal of Das was justified; and if not, whether he \\nwas entitled to reinstatement with or without com-\\npensation or any other relief in lieu thereof. Das was \\ndismissed by the company on March 12, 1955. The \\ncharge against him was that on the night of February \\n6/7, 1955, he along with one Samson, also an employee \\nof the company, committed theft of two wheels com-\\nplete with tyres and tubes from the company\\'s lorry, \\n5 W anchoo .f. 34 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] \\n\\'959 which amounted to gross misconduct under the Stand-\\n-. -ing Orders. The case was reported to the police and \\nPhulbari Tea Estate Das as well as Samson were arrested. Das remained \\nIts w;;knien in jail up to February 25, 1955, when he was released \\non bail. He reported for duty on February 28 ; but \\nWanchoo J. the manager suspended him for ten days from March 1. \\nThereafter, he was served with a charge-sheet on \\nMarch 10, 1955, asking him to show cause why he \\nshould not be dismissed for gross misconduct as men\\xad\\ntioned above. He gave a reply on March 11, that as \\nthe case was sub judice in the criminal court, the \\nquestion of dismissal did not arise at that stage and \\nthe allegations against him would have to be proved \\nin the court. On March 12, the manager held an \\nenquiry, which was followed by dismissal, on that very \\nday. We shall mention later in detail what happened \\nat the enquiry, as that is the main point which requires \\nconsideration in this appeal. To continue the nar\\xad\\nrative, however, the police submitted a final report and \\nthe magistrate discharged Das on March 23, 1955. \\nThereafter, his case was taken up by the union and \\neventually reference was made to the Tribunal on \\nMarch 8, 1956. The Tribunal came to the conclusion \\nthat the dismissal of Das was not justified on the \\nground of proper procedure not having been followed \\nand also for want of legal evidence. It went on to \\nsay that normally Das would have been entitled to \\nreinstatement but in the peculiar circumstances of this \\ncase it was of opinion that he should be granted the \\nalternative relief for compensation. Consequently, it \\nordered that Das would be entitled to his pay and \\nallowances from February 28, to March 11, 1955 and \\nfull pay and allowances from March 12, till the date of \\npayment. It also ordered that he would be entitled \\nto fifteen day\\'s pay for every completed year of service \\nalong with all benefits that accrued to him till the date \\nof final payment. This award was given on October \\n23, 1956, and was in due course published and came \\ninto force. Thereupon, there was an application to \\nthis Court for special leave to appeal, which was \\ngranted; and that is how the matter has come up \\nbefore us. , \\n..... .... \\n, . S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 35 \\nTwo points have been urged before us on behalf of z959 \\nthe company, namely- Ph lb · T E 1 1 h T \\'b l t t \\'b l u an ea s a e (1) t e r1 una was not a competen r1 una v. \\nunder s. 7 of the Industrial Disputes Act, No. XIV of Its Workmen \\n1947 (hereinafter called the Act) as it then stood; and \\n(2) the award of the Tribunal is not sustainable wa .. choo J. \\nin law as it shows as if the Tribunal was sitting in \\nappeal on the enquiry held by the company, an<l this \\nit was not entitled to do. \\nRe. (1) • \\nReference in this case was made on March 8, 1956, \\nbefore the amending Act No. XXXVI of 1956 came \\ninto force. At the relevant time, therefore, s. 7 \\nof the Act, which provided the qualifications of a \\ntribunal, required that where it was one member tri\\xad\\nbunal, he (a) should be or should have been a Judge \\nof a High Court, or (b) should be or should have been \\na district judge, or (c) should be qualified for appoint\\xad\\nment as a Judge of a High Court. The contention is \\nthat Shri Hazarika who wa.s the tribunal in this case, \\nwas not qualified under this provision. This conten\\xad\\ntion was not raised before the Tribunal and therefore \\nthe facts necessary to establish whether Shri Hazarika \\nwas qualified to be appointed as a tribunal or not were \\nnot gone into. Shri Hazarika, was an Additional \\nDistrict & Sessions Judge, Lower Assam Division, at \\nthe time the reference waa made. Assuming that he was \\nnot qualified under clause (a) above, he might well \\nhave bPen qualified under clause (b}, if he had been \\na District Judge elsewhere before he became an Ad\\xad\\nditional District Judge in this particular division. \\nFurther even if he had never been a District Judge, \\nhe might be qualified for appointment as Judge of a \\nHigh Court. These matters needed investigation and \\nwere not investigated because this question was not \\nraised before the Tribunal. In the circumstance, we \\nare not prepared to allow the company to raise this \\nquestion before us for the first time and so we reject \\nthe contention under this head. \\nRe. (2). \\nThe Tribunal gave two reasons for holding that \\nthe dismissal was unjustified; namely-(1) that 36 SUPREME COURT ltEPORTS [1960(1)) \\nz959 proper procedure had not been followed, and (2) that \\nPh Iba -:--T E 1 1 legal evidence was wanting. So far as the second • \" ea sae • d h . \" . h ... v. reason IS concerne , t ere IS .orce m t e critJCism on \\nIts Workmen behalf of the company that the Tribunal had proceed\\xad\\ned as if it was sitting in appeal on the enquiry held \\nWamhoo J. by the company. But considering that the Tribunal \\nwas also of opinion that proper procedure had not \\nbeen followed we have still to see whether that find\\xad\\ning of the Tribunal justifies the conclusion at which \\nit arrived. We may in this connection set out in \\ndetail what happened at the enquiry on March 12, \\nas appears from the testimony of the manager \\nand the documents produced by him before the Tri\\xad\\nbunal. They show that when the enquiry was held \\non March 12, certain persons, whose statements \\nhad been recorded by the manager in the absence of \\nDas during the course of what may be called investi\\xad\\ngation by the company were present. The first ques\\xad\\ntion that Das was asked on that day was whether he \\nhad anything to say in connection with the disappear\\xad\\nance of two lorry wheels and tyres from the garage. \\nHe replied that he had not.hing to say, adtling that \\nhe knew nothing about the theft. He was then told \\nthat the people who hatl given evidence aga.inst him \\nwere present a.nd he should ask them what they had \\nto say. He replied that he would put no questions to \\nthem. Then the witnesses present were asked whe\\xad\\nther the evidence they had given before the managei: \\nwas correct or not ; and if that was not correct, they \\nwere at liberty to amend it. They all replied that the \\nevidence they had given before the manager was \\ncorrect. This was all that had happened at the en\\xad\\nquiry ou March 12, 11nd thereafter the orcler of \\ndismissal was passed by the manager. The manager\\'s \\ntestimony shows that the wit.nesses who were present \\nat the enquiry were not examined in the presence of \\nDas. It also does not. show that copies of the state\\xad\\nments made by the witnesses were supplied to Das \\nbefore he was asked to question them. Further his \\nevidence does not show that t.he statements which had \\nbeen recorded were read over to Das at the enquiry \\nbefore he was asked to question the witnesses. It is -\\n.. \\n.. , .. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 37 \\ntrue that the statements which were recorded were x959 \\nProduced on behalf of the company before the Tri-Ph lb -:-T E . d d h u ari ea stat• bunal; but the witnesses were not pro uce so t at v. \\nthey might be cross-examined even at that stage on Its Workmen \\nbehalf of Das. The question is whether in these \\ncircumstances it can be said that an enquiry as Wamhoo J. \\nrequired by principles of natural justice was made in \\nthis case. \\nWe may in this connection refer to Union of India \\nv. T. R. Varma (1). That was a case relating to the \\ndismissal of a public ;;ervant and the question was \\nwhether the enquiry held under Art. 311 of the \\nConstitution of India was in accordance with the prin\\xad\\nciples of natural justice. This Court, speaking through \\nVenkatarama Ayyar J. observed as follows in that \\nconnection at p. 507 :-\\n\" Stating it broadly and without intending it to \\nbe exhaustive, it mav be observed that rules of natu\\xad\\nral justice require th.~t a party should have the oppor\\xad\\ntunity •>f a<ldueing all relevant evidence on which he \\nrelies, that the evidence of the opponent should bC\\' \\ntaken in his presence, and tha.t he should be given the \\nopportunity of cro::;s,examining the witnesses exa.min\\xad\\ned by that party, and that no materials should be \\nrelied on agairnit him without his being given an \\nopportunity of explaining them.\" \\nIt will he immediately clear that these principles \\nwere not followed in the enquiry which took place \\non March 12, inasmuch as the witnesses on which \\nthe company relied were not examined in the presence \\nof Das. It is true that the principles laid down in \\nthat case are not meant to be exhaustive. In another \\ncase New Prakf:tsh Transport Co. Ltd. v. New S\\'uwarna \\nTransport Co. Ltd. (\"), this Court held that \" rule;; of \\nnatural justice vary \\\\vith the varying con;;titutions of \\nstatutory bodies and the rules prescribed by the legis\\xad\\nlature under which they have to act, and the ques\\xad\\ntion whether in a particular case they have been \\ncontravened must be judged not by any preconceiv\\xad\\ned notion of what they may be but in the light of \\nthe provisions of the relevant Act\". In that case, it \\n(I) (1958) S.C.R. 499, (~) (1957) S.C.R. 98. 38 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] \\nz959 was held that \"the reading out of the contents of the \\nP -:--T E police report bv the Chairman at the hearing of the hulbari ea state J . . , \\nv. appeal was enough comphance with the rules of natu-\\nIts workmen ral justice as there was nothing in the rules requiring \\na copy of it to be furnished to any of the parties.\" \\nWanehoo J. That was, however, a case in which the police officer \\nmaking the report was not required to be cross\\xad\\nexamined; on the other hand, the party concerned was \\ninformed about the material sought to be used against \\nhim and was given an opportunity to explain it. The \\nnarration of facts as to what happened on March 12, \\nwhich we have given above, shows that oven this was \\nnot done in this case, for there is no evidence that. \\ncopies of the statements of witnesses who had given \\nevidence against Das were supplied to him or even \\nthat the statements made by the witnesses to the \\nmanager were read out, in extenso to Das before he \\nwas asked to question them. In-these circumstances \\none of the basic principles of natural justice in an \\nenquiry of this nature was not observed, and, there\\xad\\nfore, the finding of the Tribunal that proper procedure \\nhad not been followed is justified and is not open to \\nchallenge. \\nThe defect in the conduct of the enquiry could have \\nbeen cured if the company had produced the witnesses \\nbefore the Tribunal and given an opportunity to Das \\nto cross-examine them there. In Messrs. Basa Musa \\nSugar Works (Private) Ltd. v. Shobrati Khan (1), we had \\noccasion to point out that even where the employer \\ndid not hold an enquiry before applying under s. 33 of \\nthe Act for permission to dismiss an employee, he \\ncould make good the defect by producing all relevant \\nevidence which would hare been examined at the \\nenquiry, before the tribunal, in which case the tribunal \\nwould consider the evidence and decide whether per\\xad\\nmission should be granted or not. The same principle \\nwould apply in case of adjudication under s. 15 of the \\nAct, and if there was defect in the enquiry by the \\nemployer he could make good that <:J.efect by producing \\nnecessary evidence before the tribunal. But even that \\nwas not done in this case, for all that the company did \\n(I) c. As. Nos. 746 & 74\\'1of1957 decided on 29-4-1959. .. \\n\\' \\n-.. .. \\nI • S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 39 \\nbefore the Tribunal was to produce the statements x959 \\nrecorded by the manager during what we have called Phulbari Tea Estati \\ninvestigation. This left the matters where they were v. \\nand Das had never an opport.unity of questioning the Its Workmen \\nwitneRRes after knowing in full what they had stated \\nagainst, him. In these circumstances we are of opinion \\nthat the fiw.ling of t.he •rrilmnal that the enquiry i11 \\nthis case was uot proper is correct and must Htand. \\n\\'Ve therefore dismiss tlw appeal. We should, \\nhoweYer, like to make it elear tlrnt the order of tlw \\nTribunal fixing grant of compcnsa,tion till the date of \\npayment must be taken to be limited to the sum of \\nRs. 11,125, which has been deposited in this Court in \\npursuance of this Court\\'s order of April 22, 1957 and \\nDas will not be entitled t.o anything more, as further \\nstay of payment was pursuant to the order of this \\nCourt. In the circumstances we are of opinion that \\nthe parties should hear their own eosts of thits Court. \\nAppeal dismis8ed. \\nTHE I.ORD KRISHNA SUGAR MILV3 LTD., \\nAND ANOTHER \\nv. \\nTHE UNION OF INDIA AND ANOTH\"ll~R \\n(and connected petition) \\n(B. l:\\'.
